## IT, DIY and bike lover.

I started studying IT at secondary school, now I’m studying Computer Science at the University of Verona.  
When I’m not lost in the mountains with MTBs and friends looking for cows and drops, I like developing DIY tech projects with Arduino and Raspberry, particularly in IoT field.  
Then why don't make my prototypes much cooler with self-made speakers and leds? And don’t forget: I don’t want other people to hack my projects!
