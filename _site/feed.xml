&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the US Surgeon General issued a report on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf&quot;&gt;Our Epidemic of Loneliness &amp;amp; Isolation: Healing Effects of Social Connection and Community&lt;/a&gt;. In this talk, we examine the importance of community and the experiences of a few community organizers in the open source space. We explore getting started, staying involved and leaving communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reshama talks about Python and open source communities: the good parts (motivations of joining and contributing), and the bad (things that cause people to leave). She shared examples of communities that did great work but are now no longer operating.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Data Umbrella PyMC 2022-2023 Study Group Report</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;a href=&quot;https://reshamas.github.io&quot;&gt;Reshama Shaikh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p float=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest/2022-07_sprint/sprint_parties/sponsors.html#data-umbrella-sponsors&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/2022-2023-pymc-study-sessions/S01-pymc.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; height=&quot;80%&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px;border:solid black;&quot; align=&quot;top&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Umbrella held monthly 2-hour sessions referred to as “Study Group” or “Open Source Sessions”.  It was an opportunity for prior contributors from the Data Umbrella/PyMC OS Working Sessions to continue contributing with the presence of mentor(s) from the PyMC team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “sprints” or open source contributing sessions from which participants funneled to the “study group” were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Umbrella organized a series of 5 sessions over two months: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dataumbrella.org/data-umbrella-pymc-2022-report&quot;&gt;July &amp;amp; August 2022 PyMC Open Source Working Sessions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dataumbrella.org/du-pymc-2023-sprint&quot;&gt;Data Umbrella / PyMC March 2023 Open Source Session Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From September 2022 to August 2023, we held a total of 12 study group sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contributions-statistics&quot;&gt;Contributions Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contributions during the working sessions were tracked in this &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #CAE9F5;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11aUZN_iqPF4-oWNvFKhkPIMYLizVE_EmoHugX7kGgHY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;PyMC OS-WS spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Contributions included both submitting a pull request and opening an issue where observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a manual process and imperfect. Not all pull requests were recorded in this spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sessions&quot;&gt;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study sessions were officially held on Discord. Some participants would head over and use Google Meet because that was more suitable with the available internet bandwidth than Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;demographics&quot;&gt;Demographics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year, we had contributors and mentors join the study sessions from the following countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brazil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canada&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Germany&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;India&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kenya&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;United States of America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-worked-well&quot;&gt;What worked well?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sessions were well spaced and at a convenient time to accommodate various time zones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having “mentors” (Christian and Oriol) was great since we were able to consult and solve issues, ask questions and go through errors one on one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was really helpful to have a couple experienced contributors around. So much of navigating open source contributions relies on knowledge that’s hard to find unless someone is willing to be patient and hold your hand through it. So being able to drop in every month or so and get some help was extremely useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What worked well for me was the hands-on tasks like fixing notebook issues and ensuring their compatibility with recent PyMC versions. These tasks provided a clear direction and objective. However, given that PyMC was a new territory and with my limited background in Bayesian modelling, the depth and pace of some discussions felt overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I thought the sessions themselves worked quite well, with fewish people attending a at least a couple mentors that could go jumping around and answering questions. In fact, in many of the sessions I was abpe to spend significant time working on my own PRs thanks to this high mentor/attendee ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I think the participants enjoyed the sessions because
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;we had dedicated PyMC developers to help us and review our PRs,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;people in the sessions were welcoming and supportive, and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;there were simple issues to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants were enthusiastic, and the mentors were dedicated and passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The core developers and the Data Umbrella team are extremely helpful and instructive and I felt welcomed and respected. I learned a lot on all fronts: about Bayesian inference theory, non-trivial functionalities of git etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;did-you-enjoy-and-find-value-in-the-sessions&quot;&gt;Did you enjoy and find value in the sessions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes. It helped me understand more about contributing to open source, Git and Bayesian statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yeah I did. It was also nice to casually chat with contributors to get a sense of the community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I really liked the sessions. It was great to see how my work get merged on the repo, and I learned a bit about PyMC from the hands-on tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, I enjoyed the sessions and I think they were valuable both to the project and to the attendees, the main issue is as I have mentioned is the initiative not being followed through completely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, I could finish few PRs in these sessions and it felt nice to be doing something good for the community while having good company. Also, I got some doubts clarified which helped for my personal learning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Absolutely. Having immediate support from core developers resolves doubts that could take days or weeks to clear up asynchronously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I find it challenging [to provide feedback on the sessions] precisely because of my limited participation. I don’t use PyMC on a daily basis. Therefore, I would face a significant overhead in having to study some aspects in depth before making more sophisticated PRs. This is why I eventually decided to stop attending the meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s difficult to get started in these sessions as every person is expected to select an issue and to work individually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given that PyMC was a new territory and with my limited background in Bayesian modelling, the depth and pace of some discussions felt overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What didn’t work so well in my opinion was continuity. Only people from Data Umbrella or from PyMC attended the sessions regularly, which I think is a great opportunity loss as, in my opinion, attending twice the sessions translates in far more than twice the learnings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was unfortunate that fewer people than expected attended the study groups.  However, it was an excellent time to get extended 1-on-1 time with a PyMC maintainer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We had contributors from the West Coast of United States and Canada over to India, which spans 13.5 hours.  It was challenging to find times which accommodated the schedule of all participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-pull-requests-did-you-work-on&quot;&gt;What pull requests did you work on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Beryl] I worked on rerunning and updating the notebooks for compatibility with the latest PyMC version.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Daniel] I worked on three during the sessions
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/6652&quot;&gt;6652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/6693&quot;&gt;6693&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-examples/pull/547&quot;&gt;547&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Sangam] I contributed to the following tasks:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed issues in notebook examples.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Re-ran notebooks to ensure compatibility with the latest PyMC versions and made necessary adjustments when discrepancies were found.- Assisted in setting up and testing the development environment on GitPod.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Oriol] I didn’t keep a list of the PRs I reviewed, I know I worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-examples/pull/539&quot;&gt;539&lt;/a&gt; myself, will double check other work done during sessions that wasn’t reviewing or answering questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Sandra]
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc.io/pull/55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc.io/pull/56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/6556&quot;&gt;6556&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/6292&quot;&gt;6292&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Zoe] I worked on YouTube video descriptions and installation requirements documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Carlos] During the few meetings I attended (1 or 2), I did not create any new PRs. I spent time discussing open PRs with the core developers and gaining insight into some of the API decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;suggestions-for-improvement&quot;&gt;Suggestions for improvement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not completely sure how, but I think the best case scenario would be to have more regular attendance. Maybe an option could be to start with a ~15 min meeting with one of the mentors to work on a contribution plan that is specific to each person and builds their skills in a planned manner along the sessions until half the initiative or so when they’d be able to tackle a biggish PR of their choice (or partially their choice)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I think people joining would be interested in learning about Bayesian Statistics in general, which is not a topic most people know about. Having a 10-15 minutes explaining a topic which has open issues at the moment can help to get people working on those issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be nice that participants could have a sense of progression (for example, the ones closing a PR level 0 can move to level 1), this could help to keep attendants motivated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were not so many people attending, it could help to invite new contributors (people who get their first PR merged in any PyMC repo) to the sessions in a way that is like a support program for contributors while keeping a small manageable group.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perhaps expanding the group to include other libraries could be an option. I’m not sure about the logistics, but doing this with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn etc, might be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-feedback-and-comments&quot;&gt;Other feedback and comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall, the series worked well for me. I didn’t have time to commit to attending regularly. But the fact that they did happen regularly and I could drop in and out was really helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For future sessions, it might be beneficial to have sessions specifically for beginners that introduce PyMC to those not from a Bayesian modelling background, before they begin contributing.This would make the learning curve smoother for newcomers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These study session enabled me to build my skills in open source. They were a very good way to also learn more about git and Bayesian statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m grateful for this experience. It opened up a new avenue of learning for me, and I’m keen to delve deeper and contribute more in the coming times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thank you for organizing the sessions! I hope to be able to join again if there are similar sessions in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reshama and the PyMC leadership team deserve an award for their dedicated mentorship.&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>3 Lessons from 3 Years of Data Science</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Summary posted by: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshamas/&quot;&gt;Reshama Shaikh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting your first data science job, you are equipped with a variety of technical skills that are necessary for the job. Coursework typically focuses on mathematical theory and how to write code. However, some of the most important skills being a data scientist do not only depend on this knowledge. In this talk, Megan Robertson shares three big lessons learned from working in data science and how you can use these lessons to improve your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-get-started-0345&quot;&gt;Let’s get started (03:45)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to hand this over to Megan Robertson megan went to school up at Amherst in Massachusetts and . She’s in New York now and I’ll let Megan introduce herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;welcome-megan-401&quot;&gt;Welcome Megan (4:01)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-lessons-from-3-years-of-data-science-megan-robertson--data-scientist-412&quot;&gt;3 Lessons From 3 Years of Data Science: Megan Robertson- Data Scientist (4:12)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool ! Thanks really excited to see everybody in the chat from all over the place really appreciate you guys taking the time to come and listen to what I have to say ! so today I’m going to be talking about three lessons from three years of Data Science. So, going over what are some of the big things I’ve learned so far in my career so a little bit about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-introduction-429&quot;&gt;An Introduction (4:29)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my day today I’m currently a Data Scientist working in industry and I’ve been working with companies and consulting of various sizes for about three years I want to give a quick shout out to the legal company of my current employer and just clarify that what I’m presenting today are my own views do not represent the views of my employer at all and another thing that I’m currently working on is I’m working on a book on Data Sciencecommunication called “Mastering Communication and Data Science which will be hopefully out late of 2021 if all the deadlines are met and then in terms of my background so I do have a Masters of Statistical Science and when I was in grad school I focused particularly on the areas of Bayesian statistics machine learning as well as Python and R programming but say definitely more of my day-to-day is spent in python and that is my language of choice but I’ve also dabbled in R and I also have a background in sports analytics I interned for an MBA team when I was in school and actually my love of sports and being able to combine that with statistics through sports analytics is what really got me interested in learning more about statistics and eventually becoming a Data Scientist like I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-managementcommunicationself-promotion-603&quot;&gt;Project Management/Communication/Self-Promotion (6:03)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a quick overview of what this presentation is going to look like so these three areas Project Management, Communication and Self-promotion these are the three big areas that the lessons I’m going to talk about today fall into and these are definitely three things that have been pretty impactful to me and have helped my career up to this point and I do get a lot of requests for students just asking questions about Data Scienceand they often ask you know what do I wish I had known back when I was starting my career or when I was applying to jobs and these three things here are usually make up the bulk of the answers that I’ll give to that so I’m going to cover what each of these three lessons are as well as some ways that they show up now in my day-to-day or how I go about using these lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-project--management--658&quot;&gt;1. Project  Management  (6:58)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first in the area of project management one big thing that was especially really different from school that I learned is that the most accurate model is not necessarily always the best model so with project management I’ve definitely also learned a lot about working with people who aren’t data scientists. I could probably say a lot of lessons in this area but I think this one summarizes a lot of what i’ve learned the most. You know in school you seem to always be trying to fit that best model in terms of some sort of predictive accuracy whether it was mean squared error area under the curve or whatever metric you were looking at and I can distinctly remember being in like the bowels of the basement the night before that project was due adding variables looking for additional data trying to improve that performance and this is not necessarily now how I approach these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-most-accurate-model-is-not-always-the-best-model-0806&quot;&gt;The Most Accurate Model is Not Always the Best Model (08:06)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of why it’s important to know that the most accurate model is not always the best model is there are lots of different things that you need to consider when you’re developing a model for a project. It’s very rare for you to be working in a Data Sciencevacuum like maybe when you’re doing school projects. It was kind of just yourself and your group working on something but now in my day to day it’s very typical for me to be interacting with a marketing team or a product team or a strategy or leadership and first of all you need to be able to operate within constraints of deadlines. So sometimes I’ll get requests come in that have like they need an answer by the next day or within the week I do also get some more long-term asks but you’ll need to also be cognizant of how how much time that you have to turn this around and obviously fitting a really complicated model takes a lot more time than maybe doing something a little bit more basic or that requires less computing time or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that complex as you build more complex models this can lead to increased costs and something that I didn’t have to deal with as much before I started working in a company was the fact that my team now has a budget so it could be great that I want to fit you know maybe some really complex artificial intelligence neural network type model but at the end of the day you might only see a marginal increase in that accuracy so you have to think about not only the time that it takes to build that more complicated model even if you do see maybe an increase in that accuracy but as they say like to be cliche time is money so if I’m spending a lot of my time that’s only going to yield a really marginal return in that increased accuracy that takes away from my other priorities that I’m working on and more complex models can also just be more expensive from a computing resource stand standpoint as well .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then sort of the last reason behind this lesson is that when you’re doing black box models or ones that are more complicated those can also be really difficult to explain so this is something that is special to note especially if you’re working with stakeholders who might be less familiar with Data Scienceis that at the end of the day you do need to provide some explanation of how you got to the numbers that you’re delivering or the recommendations that you’re making and it’s a lot more complicated to explain some like big AI model versus something that might be a little bit more simpler but does the job almost as well and you definitely want to make sure that you can explain these things so that you can build trust within those teams but that I’ll touch on a little bit more later when we get to the communication section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-simple-and-evaluate-as-you-go-1118&quot;&gt;Start simple and evaluate as you go (11:18)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, How I go about like really taking this lesson in my day-to-day so first of all is whenever I start a project I tend to approach it in the same way and that is by starting simple and just evaluating as I go.
So the first thing that’s really important to do is just figure out what has been done before and this can be something that’s either internally or externally within your company so I’ll usually try to see either within my own team or if there’s some other Data Scienceteams that work closely with us like have they built a model or some sort of report that I might be able to capitalize on and see what I can reuse and then externally we’ll usually do some searches for either white papers or some other company Data Science blogs where I can see what they’ve applied in a similar situation see if I can borrow anything from that or adapt it for my own situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the next thing I’ll do is then figure out how to establish what I call a baseline level so say this is a modeling project in that case I would start out by creating a really simple model and look at however I want to evaluate that so maybe it’s the mean squared error and this is really important because then you have a score to beat that as you try to maybe add more variables to this model or just look at other analysis options you have something that you can compare it with.
So in if you were to just jump right in and try to make something really complex you throw a lot of time into that and at the end of the day it could be the simplest thing that took not as much time was actually your best solution so it’s really important that you just get a sense of okay what would be that simplest answer and what sort of evaluation can I look at to see if I beat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then as I’m going throughout this project I’m always looking at that difference in performance so for me personally for my projects I’m typically working with hundreds of millions if not billions of observation points ,so I’ll typically fit a model on like a smaller data set look at the performance and see if that will scale so what I mean by look at that performance difference is one a more complex model that’s going to require more time and more money to fit does it perform better and if the answer is yes does that difference in performance justify the amount of time and money that it would take to scale it. and this is definitely a trade-off where you need to think through the pros and cons and it’s something that I think you’ll get a better sense of to when you’re working on projects and collaborating with other teams to figure out okay in what case is it okay that we’re going to lose you know like a 0.25 difference versus something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-how-to-manage-computing-costs-1428&quot;&gt;Learn How to Manage Computing Costs (14:28)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the other big thing that i’ve learned that sort of falls into this area but I wanted to definitely have a call out for it because this is an area that I personally have learned so much out of side of school in is learning how to manage computing costs.
So, when I introduced this lesson, I said that oftentimes like teams are operating under budgets now and as you make things more and more complicated it requires more time and more computing power to to fit and finish that analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here are some things that i’ve learned that are helpful in kind of learning how to manage those costs so first of all is just learning differences between cluster settings so when I say clusters I’m referring to basically like these super computers that I can access from my personal laptop by logging into them and writing code and sending it to them so like google cloud computing resources if you’ve worked with that you’ll use clusters in that also aws or amazon web services they also have these like super computers that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ll admit too this is something that I’m still definitely learning from like in my day to day but just really understanding the differences between the certain types of processing units that can you can have in a cluster as well as what does it actually mean to give it more memory and what sort of things are stored in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of stuff out there a lot of times the companies that you’re using for these resources will post have a library of docents or information about it that can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know some of the ones i’ve worked with they provide like an office hours or have people you can reach out to to ask questions i’d say that’s definitely a great source but again like this is something I’m definitely still learning as well. So, I recognize that it seems very easy when I say learn the differences but in reality, it’s not always that simple.
And then the other thing in terms of managing computing costs is thinking about ways that you can reduce the size of the data.
So, say for example that we fit on a hundred percent of our training set but if we fit on 75 percent of our training set it would take less time and there’s only a small reduction in accuracy so just thinking through like all these different ways of can I actually reduce the size of the data that I’m running through this model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And still get comparable results can also think about do I actually need to be including all of these features in the model that I’m training maybe there’s some that are correlated enough that you can drop them or think about just getting down that size especially if you’re getting to a more complicated model.
And then I’ll say the last thing that i’ve definitely gotten better with is just using being able to take advantage of the efficiency of parallel computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I say parallel computing there are say I want to fit a bunch of smaller models and combine all of their powers to make a really complicated like bigger model I could use parallel computing in that sense that I could use a bunch of these different super computers send smaller models out to each of them and they’ll all run at the same time so that can reduce your time and your computational power as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, these are just a few areas that maybe at the end of the day you find out that simple model like does okay but you really want to get to that complicated model these are some ways that you can go about doing that.
So, before I get to the next lesson, I’m just going to check the chat real, quick to see if we have any questions come up you also there’ll be time at the end as well but okay! I don’t see any right now so we’ll move to communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-communication--1848&quot;&gt;2. Communication  (18:48)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the area of communication the big lesson here is that it’s really important to be able to explain your job to non-technical peers. So, when you’re in school you’re typically you know speaking the same language as your peers and your professors you can get up there and give a project presentation and just drop all of the jargon out there about parameterizations and loss functions and aI big data all of that stuff. But when you’re working as a Data Scientist especially if you’re in like an industry role ,You’re going to be working with a bunch of teams who aren’t data scientists and who maybe have taken an intro stats course so they don’t necessarily need to know the in-depth details you’re not going to get up in a meeting and start writing greek symbols on the board but you do need to be able to explain some of these more complex things that you’re doing to an audience that doesn’t have that same background as you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-important-to-be-able-to-explain-your-job-to-non-technical-peers-1958&quot;&gt;It’s important to be able to explain your job to Non-Technical peers (19:58)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why this is important I touched on this first point in the previous section but it’s really important that you build trust and develop a relationship with a lot of these teams that you’re working with this is especially important if you’re collaborating with a team that might not be as familiar with Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because they need to understand more about like how you come about your numbers and such because you wouldn’t expect. Oh! Okay I’m going to give you the output of this model they’re not just going to go apply your recommendations blindly they want to understand where they come from and need to have a basic understanding of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to explain your job is also really important in terms of being able to educate teams on the Data Scienceprocess so this really has to do with the first point as well because you want to have a collaborations with teams where they understand you understand their expectations they understand your expectations especially when it comes to timelines and resources i’ve definitely been in situations where people think oh Data Science I’m just going to take you know two and a half excel spreadsheets email it to you you can put it in your magic black box or crystal ball and all of a sudden all of this great information is going to come out because we’re using the data that’s often not how things really happen so being able to explain like how complicated things work can really help you just educate the people that you’re working with on that process and make sure and really ensure that you have successful collaborations moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the last point I’ll say about why this is important is this can really help you develop a Data Science brand if you’re very good at going out and talking about what you do especially to a diverse group of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is something that will be important within your own company in your own role but also outside because my previous two points you don’t want Data Science to be seen as the team that just sits off in the corner and writes all of their code and does math and then comes out with some numbers you want you do you want people to recognize you as an expert in terms of how they can get the most information out of their data how it can help them inform their strategy but you are also relying on the expertise of the other teams that you’re working with as well and you want them to help inform you throughout that partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in terms of outside of your company if you’re interested in like going to conferences and talking about your work or writing blog posts or having a presence like that that can help your career it’s really important to have these communication skills as well and you can maybe even get some new opportunities out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;break-down-topics-into-smaller-chunks-2304&quot;&gt;Break down topics into smaller chunks (23:04)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are some of the ways that I go about using this communication lesson and applying it so this is really a topic that I could talk about forever but I’ll give like a very kind of high level of how I think about some of this stuff and definitely if you have questions about it like throw them in the chat or you can also reach out to me after if you have something else you want to talk about more but I always think about when I’m presenting something that’s more complicated first thinking about how can I break this topic down into smaller chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, suppose we have a situation where I have fit a decision tree model to help a marketing team predict if someone’s going to click on an ad so I would think about the different parts of a decision tree individually and then think about how I can present them all together. So, the great thing about a decision tree is it’s basically just a flow chart that we’re figuring out the structure of using math and a lot of times if you’re working with people of more of a business background like they’ve definitely seen a flow chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this case it’s really great to have like that example that they’ve probably seen like this image before.
And to that second point it’s a decision tree at its essence is grouping together the most similar observations so we know that at the top of this flowchart we have all of in this case our customers of interest and we’re putting them into groups based on who’s most similar at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then lastly, it’s always important to just think through what are some of the assumptions and limitations of a particular model that or analysis that you’re presenting.
So, like for example in the case of the just with any model you can always talk about the risk of over fitting.
So, if I have some data where the age range of the customers are maybe only between 18 and 35 that model is not really going to apply well to someone outside of that age range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, and it’s just important to be responsible about sharing any assumptions and limitations just because at the end of the day if they you know take this analysis or take these numbers from your presentation and apply it else where they just need to understand. You don’t want you don’t want people to basically take your analysis and kind of run off with it and start applying it to a bunch of different areas that they shouldn’t and you just want to make sure that you’re getting that stuff across as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-a-reliable-and-simple-example-2555&quot;&gt;Use a Reliable and Simple example (25:55)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the other way I think about being able to communicate more effectively with the other teams that I work with is one to like walk through the model with the relatable and simple example so suppose this here shows like a very simple version of that decision tree for answering the question of okay will this customer click on the ad so I personally love putting visuals on size especially for this because it gives you something to point to you can like really just lay things out clearly for people to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, say for example our simple and relatable example we’re just going to pick one person and see how does this model work in predicting are they going to click on this ad or not so up here in this top we have all of our people are all in one group these are all of our consumers who have been shown some sort of ad so say we want to predict for me am I going to click on that ad so we would go down to this age level and here you can remind them how those buckets are split up it’s how we’ve been able to quantitatively say these people are very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say it’s pretty rare when you’re working with like a non-Data Scienceteam that they would ask for the specifics in terms of like what function did you use to define that so I wouldn’t worry so much about those details but just know okay the people who end up in this bucket together they’re all the most similar to each other at that level
So, for me I would go down to that 26 plus group and then say okay either customers are shown an ad on instagram or one on facebook for me I was shown an ad on instagram so it would follow that flow chart down and we’d see within all the 26 plus year olds shown an ad on instagram only 34 of them clicked so we’re going to predict that I don’t click because the majority of people did not click in that instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re presenting to like say this was the marketing team or something else like definitely even if your actual analysis is a little bit more complicated really try to get it to a more simple example where you can just walk through each of these so I just walked through for example what this like a simple version of this decision tree looked like but maybe in reality I had more variables or more something but this at least gets them to the fundamental concepts of we’re really just grouping together people who are super similar and then we get to a point we’re just going to predict what the majority of those people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-promotion&quot;&gt;SELF-PROMOTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4--self-promotion-2859&quot;&gt;4.  Self-Promotion (28:59)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right I’m not not seeing a question there so then we can move on to the last.
The last area and lesson in regards of self-promotion so with this and this is definitely I think one of the things i’ve learned that has had the most impact on my career it’s also one of the most challenging things is to know that you are your own best advocate
So, for me I think I definitely got used to being in school and if you study hard really learn the material put together a good presentation that’s reflected in your grade so at the end of the day good work typically seems to be noticed
But this isn’t necessarily always the case and/
This is something that can be especially challenging especially at a larger company and it’s not necessarily something that’s nefarious at all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you’re working with a lot of other people there are a lot of different projects and priorities going on sometimes you just have to like raise your hand not literally but say hey look at me look at this really hard project I just finished and I definitely had to get used to promoting myself and talking about my own accomplishments
Because I found that I was constantly worried about oh am I going to come across as I’m bragging even though I’m actually I actually wasn’t but I feel like especially in my first three years and tending to be the more junior person in the room I also would doubt myself in terms of oh well sure I did finish this project but you know I’m sure someone who is a senior level could have done it so much more so or so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-are-your-own-best-advocate-3046&quot;&gt;You are your own best advocate (30:46)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in terms of why this is a really important lesson is I just want to start off by saying that like it is important to know that you are an asset to your team so even if like you’re still in school studying this working group projects or if you’re someone who’s working as a Data Scientist now like recognize that your skills are valuable you make an impact and that you would not get to the point where you are today if someone else didn’t recognize your potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know imposter syndrome gets thrown around a lot especially in our field and it’s going to make you always have that little voice in the back of your head that’s like oh no like I just got lucky they didn’t actually you know oh they didn’t actually read my application that closely or someone else you know should be here more than me.
And I know that’s not always hard to ignore but just definitely like take some time and recognize what are some things that you’re good at to try to combat some of some of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another thing that I think is why this being your own advocate is important falls under in relation to mentors and advocates those are also very important I’ll talk a little bit more about like how to go about finding those in the next couple slides. But just some definitions to provide here so a mentor is somebody who I think of as like providing assistance and helping you out with career navigation so i’ve had mentors who are data scientists i’ve also had mentors outside of the space who I typically go to more for just like professional questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you would go to them to ask like oh hey I just I’m facing this situation at work how do you think I should proceed or they can really be helpful in guiding the next steps of your career and helping you figure out what you want to do on the other hand an advocate is somebody who is helping to actually create opportunities for you and will go to bat for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So like this can typically be someone like a more senior member on your team or even your manager and that they know what you want to do and if something comes up that you’re interested in or that would benefit for you like they’ll go to whoever they need to and say like yes I hope like I support this person I think they’d be a great fit for it and really help you in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again they could be potentially the same person but also there’s a pretty noticeable difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the other reason why it’s important to be your own best advocate is how this can help you with career development so when you’re advocating for yourself you’ll definitely be more likely to have a direction that really interests you or work on projects that are more exciting to youI think for me I do recognize that like saying career development especially after I just got in my first job seemed like a very overwhelming thing because I applied to so many jobs in the beginning I finally got one can take a breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now it seems like oh well now I have to figure out what I want to do next and what do I want to work on and all of that I’m going to touch on career development also in the next couple slides so don’t feel too overwhelmed by that because that’s something definitely I was. But it doesn’t have to be as like you don’t have to have a concrete five ten-year plan there are other ways that you can think about it.
And advocate for yourself so that you end up just learning things that are interesting to you and really getting you closer to your own personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-inside-and-outside-the-company-3454&quot;&gt;Network Inside and Outside the Company (34:54)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright so how to then go about advocating for yourself one is the dreaded networking world word so it’s really important to network inside and outside of your company one way to do that first of all is to contribute to any regular summary content so different companies will do this differently but typically either once a week or once a month they’ll either have a meetup or a stand up or some sort of email or report that goes out that highlights you know what are some of the big projects or what are some of the things that people are working on so if they do that wherever you are definitely like think about contributing to that talking about the work that you’re doing getting it done if one doesn’t exist but it seems like the team’s big enough or the company’s big enough that would be like a good idea maybe think about like leading that initiative to start one just again it’s especially at those larger companies you just want to make sure people recognize what you’re doing they see your name in relation to the work that you’re putting out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point to this that’s not necessarily about like contributing to regular smary content but typically a lot of companies will have like an annual review process so something that I’ll do is even just keep a like a note on my work computer of some of the big projects that I’m working on and what are either some of the big breakthroughs or the new skills that I Picked up on that just&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you know 12 months go by and it can be hard to remember everything that you did especially this year because three months feels like 10 years. But just get used to keePIng track of all the different things you’ve done and skills you’ve learned because that can come in handy when you then go at the end of the year to have those conversations with your manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing in terms of networking how to go about it and this is something that I like absolutely hated when I started out is just set up one-on-ones or to use sort of the business lingo coffee chats with people this can be definitely the people inside a company if you already are working that either work tangentially tangent I can’t say that even a math person that work very closely with your team maybe or even in other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you’re a student or working to looking to break into Data Scienceit can also just be people that you find whose work that you’re interested in. So, for me I started out by like reaching out within an alumni network so whether that be through a college or if you do a boot camp or any sort of program like that oftentimes/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have a directory of people that you can reach out to. And that I found really helpful at least to start out with because I could then there was a common ground that I had just that connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would also recommend for this like definitely plan some questions and talking points ahead of time I think for me I always found this stressful because it was like what if we don’t have anything to talk about and all of that but if you come with some questions ahead of time and you get more practice with this you’ll definitely get more comfortable having those conversations with other people. And I will say too I think one of the biggest things that I why I did not like this at first as a student is I always felt like I was going out and asking people for things and not really having as much to offer in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’d say definitely like if people respond and are willing to talk with you. Like if you’re reaching out like as a student, they probably already know that it’s going to be more of like answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also know that like you don’t have to get really far in your career to then like have people that you network in network with have a benefit from knowing you as well it’s like. For example, like one to two years into my own career after I met someone at an event that I went to like I ended up helping him find an intern to hire. So just know that you don’t have to be like super senior or have done all these projects to necessarily have like a networking relationship where you’re also helping other people as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-inside-and-outside-the-company-3938&quot;&gt;Network Inside and Outside the Company (39:38)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then start with this last one just so I’m not sure where I dropped off but so it’s really important when you’re reaching out to these people to do research before you send a message , it’s definitely pretty easy to tell if someone’s just copying and pasting those same messages to a bunch of different people and changing the name, so take a little bit of time read their blogs, look on linkedin and see what sort of information can you add in there just to help yourself stand out a little bit and show that you’re also invested because the reality is that a lot of these people are probably receiving messages from like a ton of people and you want to make sure that you can differentiate yourself from the group a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;actively-think-about-career-development-4033&quot;&gt;Actively Think About Career Development (40:33)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the other way that I apply this lesson then in my day today is actively thinking about career development. So, again this is something that when I first got my job my first data science job seemed very overwhelming of just finally I finished school I got the degree I landed a job like let’s take a deep breath and then it seemed like well no now I have to it’s very overwhelming to then think about okay what does the future look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m here to tell you it does not have to be that overwhelming so just a couple of things i’ve learned in regards to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first of all in Data Science, typically you’ll see jobs or two different career paths exist of you can either become in what’s called an individual contributor or more of a management role ,so typically and again this isn’t the same for every company but you’ll come in as a Data Scientist there might be like one or two senior levels above that and then you get to like a fork in the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where one is that is path one is a manager so what it means then to be an individual contributor is you are somebody who spends more time like writing code building models working on projects you might have one or two people report to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day more of your time is still spent like coding and doing the math and statistics side of things versus someone who goes more down a manager path they’ll be somebody who is like who’s leading a larger team and helping guide a lot more of this long-term strategy and priorities of things so you’ll typically they’ll typically spend a little bit more time in meetings in terms of understanding different requests that come in for the team figure out can they take on more requests what has more priority and they’ll also they’re responsible for more people and will also typically play a large part in career development for their team as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, again that’s just something that’s good to know because as you’re working on different projects and doing different things it’s just good to get a sense of to this next point what type of work makes you happy like if you find yourself hating going to all these meetings around project planning and all of that that’s probably okay if you don’t like that maybe management isn’t necessarily what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But definitely just even thinking about what types of work makes you happy is really important. Because again you don’t have to make this crazy five-year plan. But in your day-to-day think about what are the things that you enjoy what are your favorite things to do like what is the stuff that you don’t quite look forward to doing what do you want to learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me I found for example that I really liked being able to be like the person in between Data Science and the people that we work with in terms of like I still spend a lot of my day-to-day writing code and building models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I really liked being able to take all the analysis that I did and help somebody who wasn’t in Data Science do their job better or answer their questions or really help shape that like answer their questions that might be shaping the overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I’ve also found I personally really enjoy the opportunities I’ve had with mentoring more junior employees and helping them start out some of their first projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me personally it’s like okay that means at this point like I’m more interested in probably thinking about that manager path but again like career development doesn’t have to be this crazy I’m going to have all the details of my next few years planned out it can be as simple as identifying what do you like to do what don’t you like to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once you figure that out it’s really important that you share those goals and don’t be quiet about what you want so this is a great thing to just talk about with your manager and some of your other colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if they know what you want like for example your manager is going to be aware of opportunities and upcoming projects often times before you are and if they know like okay hey like Megan really likes working with more junior employees that she can help mentor and build their skills like here’s a project where I know like she could take more of a leadership role in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, don’t be afraid to talk about that because you want other people just to be aware of what you’re interested in as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-4532&quot;&gt;Summary (45:32)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, then to wrap it up with just a quick smary of what the three lessons are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first of all better accuracy doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a better model at the end of the day your best solution is going to be the one that meets the project means but also really makes the best use of time and money when compared to your other priorities. Again, it’s a lot easier said than done in that sentence there but this is something that you’ll get a better sense of as you start doing more projects. It’s also really important to develop strong communication skills you need that so you can build relationships with other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a sense of trust among the people that you’re working with and it can also be great if you do want to pursue some opportunities in terms of speaking at conferences or at meetups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then lastly know that you are your own best advocate so even when that imposter syndrome creeps in and you doubt yourself don’t be afraid to speak up for yourself to your home your own horn about your accomplishments and really be sure to go after what it is you want and just make sure that you’re sharing your career goals with the people that you work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-4653&quot;&gt;Questions (46:53)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what I have for you guys today so here I have my twitter handle @LEGGOMYMEGG04 / MEGROBERTSON.WEEBLY.COM as well as my website so if you have any questions or anything that you want to ask about or chat about you can definitely dm me on twitter or I have like a contact field on my website as well but I’m also happy to take what questions we have time for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderator: Hi. Megan,so there is a question in the Q&amp;amp;A, I could read it from Sandeep it is related to the first section could you highlight some of the at-scale computing methodologies that you found to be key the best ways to learn them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! for sure so I’d say for me personally the biggest things that I’ve learned that has been helpful has been using PySpark. In terms of the best way to like learn it right now,
it’s a little different because I feel like when I was in school there wasn’t as much of a focus on like big data computing. So, I personally just learned a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By okay here’s this problem I have at work and we got to get it done somehow. So, kind of trial by fire. But I’d say like figuring out one good thing to really learn more about like I was saying before is parallel computing. So, PySpark you can actually use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like implementation of using the spark language in python. That can help you run things in parallel. And I honestly like I said a lot of I learned was just like I need to figure this out. But I would say definitely look into parallel computing, the spark language. Just because there’s a lot of stuff that fits in there in terms of figuring out. Or that explains like how it works and what the difference is between the terminology that they use. And then I would say just go and like find some large data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some machine learning data repositories out there with some good data sets of just download it. And like just start trying to write code and see okay. If I just fit a model like this versus if I maybe use like that PI spark in parallel for example like being able to see that difference. But on the top of my head I can’t really think of any particular good resources. But that’s also because I just kind of had to learn this by trial by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-on-confidential-information-4941&quot;&gt;Question on confidential information (49:41)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next question is from Sandra and she asks how do you share your accomplishments outside of your company without revealing proprietary or confidential information? Yes! so this definitely hits a little close to home for me per my disclaimer at the beginning. So, I think how I typically go about it is well one I just start by thinking about okay what are my accomplishments like. If I could say anything for example like what would I want to go out and like either put on like a linkedin bullet point or something like that. And then from there I kind of work backwards in terms of like okay well what do I know I definitely can’t talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then once I get to like I have sort of not a watered-down version but like removing some of that proprietary or confidential stuff then typically I’ll like ask my manager or like talk to the appropriate department about that if I need to,
But I’m trying to I know this sounds like a very vague answer just because for me like because I’m technically giving an external presentation this answer I’m giving is very different than what I would tell you individually. But I would say there’s definitely like think about could you talk about like maybe you worked on developing a new feature for something and you know it impacted like ex customers. Like usually something like that quantifying it that way you can usually do as long as you’re not you know talking about that underlying model or technology that you use for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technologies-used-in-job-5140&quot;&gt;Technologies used in job (51:40)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay the next question is from Kenisha which is when you first started in industry were there any technology or techniques that we that you didn’t know how to use or do that were necessary for the job and if so how were you able to learn it was it via company training or self training?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! so I think for me definitely the biggest thing was just figuring out how to work with very large data sets. I think I had maybe one lecture in grad school where the professor was like this is AWS. And I honestly didn’t remember anything from that so I think definitely like learning that cloud computing stuff was helpful. That was a combination of just having people either on my team who had background in that really help out learn that. But also, just kind of diving into a project where I needed to know it and looking at code that was either on blog post or elsewhere in applying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think that there’s a lot more out there in terms about having like just the background of how these different technologies work so i’d say that’s definitely one thing i’ve learned a lot about on the job.
And then the other thing I think would just be like database querying so I personally use SQL.
And part of that I feel like it was my first I I had done like the sql course on like khan academy or something which was very good but until I had that like first internship where I was actually going through and generating features from the data and joining tables like then I really felt like I mastered SQL.
So I think for both of those it’s really a combination of like doing an online course or reading blog post but then also like having to implement it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-internship-5344&quot;&gt;Q: internship (53:44)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay Thank you. The next question is from Kailande which is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think it is essential to have a Data Science internship before landing one’s first full-time position specifically for people with non-CS computer science backgrounds but with data experience with R and Python through quantitative research experiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! So,I think that it’s definitely helpful to have an internship it’s not necessarily going to be a deal breaker all the time again that’ll depend on the company as well. But I think when we’re like when a company is looking to hire a Data Scientist, they really want somebody who has like a quantitative background so just in terms of understanding. Like probability like intro stats maybe a little bit of machine learning it’s great that you’ll know code. But I think as long as you can demonstrate that you have the different skills necessary to be able to take some sort of business question or request. Think about it figure out how you can translate that into something quantitative that you can look at with the data that you have be able to run whatever analysis you think makes sense. And then communicate that back to whoever it is you’re working with like that’s fundamentally what a Data Scientist does. And what companies are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, having an internship can be a great way to get that experience. But you can also demonstrate that with other ways I think one of the biggest questions I’ll always get is I’m trying to find my first Data Science job.
But I don’t have any experience how can I get experience if I don’t have one. So, you can also think about like the stuff that you’re doing either in school or even in your free time or through Kaggle. Just think about okay what where can I take a data set find that interesting story using my technical skills. And be able to communicate what’s important from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, like Data Science will help with that an internship will help with that but it’s not necessarily a deal breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5602-first-job&quot;&gt;56:02 first job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay the next question is from Neely which is could you share more about how you landed your first Data Sciencejob out of grad school?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! So,I will say that I first started out in a very inefficient manner of coming out of school I was like okay well I’m just going to apply to as many places as possible because at the end of the day somebody will like respond to me. And yes, that was true but I found that it was a lot of you know effort and time put into submitting these online applications. And I wasn’t necessarily seeing the return that I got that I would have wanted. And I think like part way through that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I from like reaching out to some of my other classmates or just people that I knew. In the area I kind of shifted my approach to them more thinking about like, building a network, as a way to go about finding jobs. So, the reality is like if a company posts a Data Science position typically, they really get inundated with a ton of applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even if you are the most qualified qualified applicant at the end of the day like you might your resume just might get buried and like because so many people are applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I shifted more towards of like focusing on networking but networking with the sense of like I definitely want to make sure that I’m connecting with people who are working at companies I’m interested. Or areas, like specific areas that I’m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because again like I I do not recommend going out and just asking random people to refer you to a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I found that like if you go out and like have conversations and ask them like what it’s like to work at their company and all of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of times it would just come up organically they’d say oh if you see a position, you’re interested in let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes there wasn’t a position open at that company but down the line like something came up that I could talk to them about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, again I did have success in terms of I got job offers from just applying on websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I found that my time was much more effect effective in taking that networking approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well yes, I’m still job hunting but there’s also just a lot of great information that I learned along the way about working in Data Scienceas well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-deciding-on-a-domain-to-focus-5842&quot;&gt;Q: Deciding on a domain to focus (58:42)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay the next question is from Sandeep. Could you please provide some pointers on deciding on a domain even if I don’t have much experience in it, I’m sure you found it cool to find a job in the domain that interested interested you from the outset?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Definitely, So I think one of the cool things about Data Science is it basically you can like every company has it for the most part or not company but you can be in retail you can be in sports you can be in medicine all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think for me like my initial job right out of school I was working for a now defunct company that like tracked engagement for online publications so wasn’t necessarily something that I was personally super interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think for me I saw the opportunity of like I knew I wanted to be in a position where I could be working a lot with a lot of different teams and helping them do their that job better I think also a big part of it too was when I had interviewed and like meeting the people that I would eventually work with I could tell that like one that they were people that I would like personality-wise like got along with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could tell that the head of the team was like very invested in building out the Data Scienceteam within the company as well as helping his employees to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would say like definitely if it’s in an industry you’re not familiar with kind of just see get a sense of what sort of projects that they’re working on because like my first job I was definitely not passionate about online art like online publication engagement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I did find that there was a really big benefit in terms of like being able to work with the team that I was in and the projects that the team was working on like I got to learn new things obviously about that area but also things that really interested me in terms of new techniques that I hadn’t learned before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah and you know just to add to that I think one thing that i’ve learned is it is interesting like how many how much skills and knowledge from one domain are transferable to another domain. For sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-writing-effective-linkedin-bullet-points-010100&quot;&gt;Q: Writing effective LinkedIn bullet points (01:01:00)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next question is from Neely which is, yes we have time for question do you have any tips on writing good or effective Data Science Linkedin bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! so I think for that I think a common thing that gets thrown around that I do agree with is it can be helpful to try to figure out a way to quantify like projects that you’re working on so if you did a project that like influenced like say some marketing campaign for 50,000 people for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you know if you implemented an a b test that ultimately like your recommendation cause like x dollars and increase in revenue or something i’d say that’s definitely put that in there because that can be very helpful for when somebody who’s maybe not as familiar with the Data Scienceis looking at it so like maybe someone who’s an hr is in charge of hiring for a position for example because like by seeing a number they’ll at least be able to get a sense of the impact of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think also highlighting any instances where you’re like I feel like teamwork is always something that can sometimes get overlooked so talking about like the teams that you’ve worked with or collaborated with because at the end of the day like maybe if you’re at some super research heavy position but otherwise you’re going to be working with people who aren’t data scientists so they want to get a sense of do you have those communication skills as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think I whenever I’m updating things I’ll usually or like if I’m updating my resume for whatever reason I’ll definitely try to add a bullet point that focuses on some of those non-technical skills as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last thing I’ll say too about like Data Science Linkedin bullet points or even bullet points on your rese is like if you are gonna like definitely mention like the different coding languages that you use for a project or the models or algorithms that you used but if you’re going to mention them there definitely make sure that you can answer a question about them just i’ve been in cases where i’ve interviewed people and they say oh yes I fit this this and this model definitely make sure you can then ask some questions about like the math behind that model or how you went about doing tha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re having bullet points from like earlier projects definitely make sure that you review those kind of so they’re fresh before you go into an interview because we definitely look at Linkedin profiles as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-010400&quot;&gt;Q: (01:04:00)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s one more question here which is have you experienced gender bias or microaggressions in your career and how have you navigated that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Yeah! So, I think being a woman in a usually male dominated field this has definitely come up I can think of many kind of different experiences that fall under this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like I think of one example in grad school where kind of just a group working on a problem set and I shared the correct like oh no we should try this and it turns out being right and myself and my friend were the only ones that were listened to me and then we had a a male student in the group say the same thing 30 minutes later and I was like wait literally I already said that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s something that is definitely getting better I think that people now especially with some of the events that have happened this year are more likely to kind of recognize that okay like people who tend to be minority in spaces like they do get treated differently at times and I don’t even acknowledge when that happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think for me one it’s been very helpful to find not support groups but like all like one of my mentors that I have like all often like talk to her about some of this stuff because she’s in a more senior position than me and just like that can even just be helpful in terms of like okay am I crazy like just having some other people to talk about who are also experiencing it is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I think two I definitely have gotten better at kind of figuring out okay when something happens okay what’s the best way to address this and like when to bring it up and I think too like i’ve definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be uncomfortable at times as well as it’s definitely not easy but i’d say one of the biggest things that i’ve gotten more comfortable with doing than that I would find a lot in meetings at times that I would like be interrupted a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or like people weren’t really quiet, like paying as much attention to my points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, like this is not necessarily easy and can be uncomfortable but like if some I got better at okay if someone tries to cut me off and I’m not done like I’ll just keep talking and then usually they’ll get the hint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think too also just like identifying people that you can trust within your team as well can be helpful too to kind of have an ally with that it’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like for example in one of my previous roles like I had someone who was male who like in meetings and this was like I didn’t even ask at all but I was like afterwards was like wow thank you I really appreciate that where like if I got interrupted he’d be like well wait Megan wasn’t done talking like you need like let’s hear what she has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think kind of finding just people who you trust that can maybe help you with some of that but then also recognize that like at some times you might have to have that uncomfortable moment of like being in the meeting and just keePIng talking while someone’s interrupted you or another thing that I’ll do from time to time is like if I say something and then the classic you know someone else repeats it and everyone’s like oh wow that’s great all done ask oh like can you highlight how that’s different from what I just said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, it’s not easy but definitely like try to find that support system as well so that you can have like a place to vent also about it too because that can be definitely therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question which is from Astato which is sorry if I mispronounced it did you work with a project that uses deep learning models if yes what a takeaway can you give about deep learning framework which one would you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;010845&quot;&gt;(01:08:45)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done some stuff with the deep learning models in terms of i’ve had a one or two projects that where was looking at building various neural networks for things , I personally don’t have too much experience in terms of like actually bringing it from like the development stage into production just because it didn’t really work in our use case so I don’t personally have like a specific recommendation about deep learning frameworks right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do know some people who use TensorFlow though and really love it but like I said I only I didn’t really make it past the exploratory stage in my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Megan! Thank you so much for presenting we had a lot of questions and a lot of interest it was a really great presentation yeah did you have any final words you wanted to say.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean I think this was really just the three big themes I feel like really summarize what I’ve done so far but. I want to say thanks to all of you again for showing up and asking some great questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And definitely like feel free to reach out like on my contact informations up here as well and just know that it can feel very overwhelming especially early on in your career in Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And definitely like try not to get too discouraged by what you see other people doing and just know if you follow what you’re passionate about And what you want to learn about like things are going to fall into place for you and you’ll end up finding something that you like doing okay. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgments&quot;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/data-umbrella/event-transcripts/issues/27&quot;&gt;Sethupathy&lt;/a&gt; for submitting the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Bayesian Data Analysis with BRMS (Bayesian Regression Models Using Stan)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Summary posted by: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshamas/&quot;&gt;Reshama Shaikh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitzi Morris, a Stan developer, shows how you can quickly build robust models for data analysis and prediction using BRMS (Bayesian Regression Models Using Stan). After a brief overview of the the advantages and limitations of BRMS and a quick review of multi-level regression. We will work through an R-markdown notebook together, to see how to fit, visualize, and test the goodness of the model and resulting estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;0000-intro&quot;&gt;00:00 Intro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reshama: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Data Umbrella and our collaboration with R-Ladies New York City webinar today. First of all, we’re going to have the R-Ladies introduction and I’d like to introduce you all to Dorota Ritzik and she is going to share a bit about the R-Ladies community particularly the New York City Chapter. So, welcome Dorota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;0025-r-ladies-nyc-intro&quot;&gt;[00:25] R-Ladies NYC Intro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorota: Thank you. Yes. Hi, everybody. I’m here to just give a very quick intro to R-Ladies and what we’re about and I am one of the lead organizers for R-Ladies NYC, the New York City Chapter. So, there’s R-Ladies Global which I’ll talk about it a little bit at first and then I’ll go into more detail about our specific chapter. So, what is R Ladies? R-Ladies is a worldwide organization that promotes gender diversity in our community via meetups and mentorships in a friendly and a safe environment. And our mission is to have more women and non-binary coders, developers, speakers, and leaders in our community. We believe firmly that more diversity, equity, inclusion of people developing our packages and being a part of our community is a fantastic thing and that’s what we strive for. And R-Ladies Global is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a ton of chapters all over the world. I am actually not 100% sure when this image was taken. So, it’s possible there are even more chapters at this point but we are everywhere and it’s actually not that hard to get involved. If you don’t have a local chapter where you live, there’s a way to very easily start one. So, I highly recommend looking into that. To do that, you can just send an email to info@Rladies.org to get in touch. You can follow R-Ladies on social media, on Twitter, LinkedIn, and yeah, you can follow all these different chapters from all over the world. It’s great. It’s a really wonderful community to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So more about R-Ladies NYC. We were founded around 2017. So, several years after R-Ladies initially began and was already in several different places both in the US and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few fun facts. So, we currently have actually we’re up to like 2900 members on meetup at this point. So, it’s quite large. That said, we don’t always have a huge turnout at meetup events. So, don’t be discouraged by that very large number. We host events monthly and contacting us is really easy. You can check out our website, “RLadiesNYC.org”. You could find us on meetup or on Twitter and LinkedIn and there on the left is a list of our current board members, our wonderful group of R-Ladies that helps make these monthly events possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, join us. We host meetup events like presenters giving talks both technical and professional development talks. We host a book club. We host networking and social events and we typically try to attend a few conferences here and there and it’s great. It’s wonderful. We have a wide variety of ways to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of participating, here are few ways to get involved. First and foremost, attend our meetups, follow us on Twitter and other social media pages. Join our Slack Channel and GitHub pages. And ask questions. You could even write a blog post for our website if you want to try your hand with that. We are always encouraging folks who haven’t really written or presented on about our technical topic before to get involved. So, please reach out if you’re interested in either of those options. And like I mentioned earlier, you could also sponsor a local chapter if you don’t have one near you. Or join the board of the New York City Chapter if you’re in the area. And most importantly, spread the word and tell your friends. We are always looking for more R-Ladies to join our community. Here’s some information and that is it. That’s the end of my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[04:40] Laura: Okay. So, Reshma, you’re muted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[04:45] Reshama: Yes, I’m going to do the Data Umbrella introduction. Hang on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[04:48] Laura: Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[04:50] Reshama: That’s okay. Slides, there we go. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;0455-data-umbrella-intro&quot;&gt;04:55 Data Umbrella Intro:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, everybody. So, I’m going to introduce the data umbrella part of it. We’re really happy to do this co-promotion and co organization with R-Ladies. It’s been something we’ve wanted to do for a while. So, I’m going to do a brief introduction. Mitzi will do a presentation and you can ask any questions in the chat and we will answer them as a good time to stop and answer. This is being recorded and the video will be available on YouTube typically within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Umbrella is a community for underrepresented persons in data science and we are a non-profit organization. This is the team of Data Umbrella. We are in a few different countries around the world and there’s a bunch of people that make it happen behind the scenes. We have a code of conduct and we thank you for helping to making a welcoming, friendly, professional environment for everybody. There are various ways to support Data Umbrella. One of those ways is to follow our code of conduct. Another way that you can do it is to ask general questions and share job events and postings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also donate to our nonprofit. We are an open collective and if you work for a company that uses Benevity which is company match donations, that’s another way to make a donation. You can subscribe to the Data Umbrella YouTube channel. We have over 80 videos there on all different data science topics and we have over 2000 subscribers. We have a bunch of playlists. One of them is career advice. We have playlists such as data visualization contributing to open source, scikit-learn, PyMC emcee, and NumPy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a monthly newsletter and I’ll share the link in the chat to find out about upcoming events and announcements. Our website which we are in the process of redesigning at the moment has a lot of resources on open-source conferences allyship language. We encourage you to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re on all social media platforms as Data Umbrella. The place to find out about upcoming events is meetup. I’ve mentioned YouTube and the newsletter and Twitter and LinkedIn are the two platforms where we are the most active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This webinar platform is big marker and then on the top you’ll see a CC for closed captioning, so you can have live transcripts enabled for this presentation if you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a call for volunteers. So, for all of our videos we add timestamps. So, if you’re available to add time stamps, I’ll share the link to it for this video or some other videos. You can add those timestamps on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a feedback form which you’ll find in the handout section and that is I’ll also share the link once I’m finished speaking and if you have any technical issues or suggestions for future event topics or any general feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have couple of upcoming events in March. The first one is what’s a sales engineer from a data science of computer science background. That’s going to be a very fascinating talk and on March 21st, we have MLOps from concept to product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;0825-speaker-introduction---mitzi-morris&quot;&gt;08:25 Speaker Introduction - Mitzi Morris:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s talk is Bayesian Data Analysis with BRMS with Mitzi Morris who is a returning speaker. Mitzi is a member of the Stan Development Team and serves on the Stan Governing Body. Since 2017, she’s been a full-time Stan developer working for Professor Andrew Gelman at Columbia University where she has contributed to the Core Stan C++ platform and developed CmdStanPy, a modern python interface for Stan. She’s also an active Stan user developing, publishing, and presenting on Bayesian Models for disease mapping. Prior to that, she has worked as a software NG in both academia and industry working on natural language processing and search applications as well as data analysis pipelines for genomics and bioinformatics. Feel free to tweet about this event at Data Umbrella. And with that, I will turn off my mic and video and hand over the screen shared to Mitzi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;0924-mitzi-morris&quot;&gt;[09:24] Mitzi Morris:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for that really great introduction and yes, I used to do natural language processing which is what we’re not going to talk about today. Today, we’re going to talk about Bayesian data analysis with BRMS and yes. So, I as a Stan developer have not really used BRMS, but BRMS is just really, I think well, it’s the most widely used interface of the Stan interfaces, so/and it is absolutely fantastic. So, why don’t I keep going with my slides so we can make this all very concrete and clear for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1015-what-is-brms-bayesian-regression-models-using-stan&quot;&gt;10:15 What is BRMS? (Bayesian Regression Models Using Stan):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, BRMS stands for Bayesian Regression and multi-level modeling in Stan. The developer who started this project is Paul Berkner. He’s German which I think is why multi-level modeling is such one-word noun phrase in that particular use of multi-level modeling. BRMS package uses the R-formula Syntax which if you’re familiar with are and fitting regression models in R. This is the general syntax that’s used to fit to describe a model, a regression model. And so, snippet of code here we’re going to go through and get to see how BRMS works. But first, some more background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1115-three-reasons-to-use-brms&quot;&gt;11:15 Three reasons to use BRMS:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question here is why should I use BRMS? If you want to do Bayesian modeling, if you want to do regression modeling, you should use BRMS. If you’re working in R and you’re at all, you’ve heard about Stan then you should actually learn about BRMS. Because BRMS simplifies model development and it uses the extended R-formula syntax to specify the likelihood. It has a function set prior to specify the priors on all the parameters and the BRMS package has lots and lots and lots of checks so that you can make sure that your model is actually fitting your data. And the downstream analysis packages that are also part of the Stan ecosystem, bayesplot, projpred and loo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesplot is the package that gives you plotting, lets you visualize everything in your fitted model. Projpred is used to investigate the particular of interest in your model and it’s helping you see what kinds of predictions those particular parameters are going to make for you. And loo stands for (Leave One Out) cross validation and loo is a tool for comparing different models. BRMS generated Stan programs are efficient and robust. So, if you have a data set and you know how you would like to model your data. You have some idea of the multi-level model that you want. Which of the predictors are going to be most relevant which of the predictors have some kind of grouping structure. Working with BRMS is very nice, because you can quickly try out a lot of different variations on how much of the problem you want to put into your model and then with BRMS, you write a whole bunch of models and you can use the downstream analysis packages to do the model comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1351-bayesian-workflow-overview&quot;&gt;13:51 Bayesian Workflow Overview:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this in a nutshell is the Bayesian workflow. The Bayesian workflow, a lot of times when you’re learning about Stan or learning about a problem set in doing Bayesian data analysis, the model is presented to you. And you’re taught the model, the structure of the model, how it fits in with the data, and how well it works with your data set. But what you need to understand is that model development is the first piece of the puzzle. The second piece of the puzzle is model comparison. Some models are going to be too simple. They’re easy to write, simple to understand but they don’t really work that well. Some models are too complex. Some models are difficult to fit or some models are going to by building in too much complexity in your model, you might build a model that gives you a very good analysis for the data set that you have. But it might be overfitting, because you’ve just put too much stuff in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, you want to do model development. You want rapid model development. You want to be able to specify a lot of models very quickly and then you want to be able to do model comparison and to do that BRMS package and its friends give you everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1525-modeling-terminology-and-notation&quot;&gt;15:25 Modeling Terminology and Notation:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s just a little bit of modeling terminology and notation because you’re going to see these terms and you’re going to see some of this notation everywhere. So, I feel like we always have to go through the slide. We’re talking about data and when we say data Y. We’re talking about all of the data. We’re not making a distinction between your outcome and your predictors. When we talk about Theta, we mean all the parameters in your model and we’re building a Bayesian model. So, we’re build a joint probability distribution over all the data and the parameters and when you write a stand program, Stan is solving the joint probability density. So, it’s fitting all of the parameters all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the important things to keep your eye on when you’re doing Bayesian modeling is this notion of the prior probability distribution, P of Theta. This is what you know about your problem before any data are observed, and then P of Theta given why the posterior probability distribution is what you’ve learned from your data. So, it’s the probability of the parameters being what you’ve estimated them to be conditional on the data that you’ve seen with that starting point of P of Theta, what you already knew before you started fitting the data to the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that we’re really talking about though is the probability of why given theta, the probability of the data given the parameters. And when you know the data, when you’re fitting your model, this is the model’s likelihood. Once you fitted your model and you’ve got an estimate for Theta which is fixed, this is your sampling distribution and you use this sampling distribution to generate new data or I mean to fit new, to make predictions for new previously unseen data. So, these are our terms and the things that we’re going to be talking about are prior, our posterior probability distribution, and our likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1754-multilevel-regression&quot;&gt;17:54 Multilevel Regression:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Multi-level regression”, I’m quoting here Richard McElreath, if you haven’t read statistical rethinking this is the book that we recommend to absolutely everybody. “Statistical Rethinking” is going to make statistics. It’s designed to make thinking about statistics far less confusing than it probably has been in any statistics class that you’ve taken. So, get “Statistical Rethinking” and read it and the argument that McElreath makes is that multi-level regression is the default form of regression because multi-level regression models handle structured data and almost all of your data has some structure. Your observations can sometimes be repeated from the same source or else they’re ordered or there’s some group structure in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, example of group structure is a hierarchical model where you have students in classrooms, classrooms are in a school, schools are in districts, districts are in states, states are in regions. And each of those nested areas is going to probably make the data from that particular school be of a certain flavor. So, we expect that when there’s a hierarchical structure, we’re getting a little bit of information from node above your bottom most, your leaf note in the tree. We’re getting information from all of those contributing to your observation. Or if you have say an auto, regressive you have time series data where the next item depends on the previous several items possibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial data where you have some observation a we expected to be sort of similar to observations that are neighboring, spatio-temporal where we blow the whole thing out into one big 4D. It’s my neighbor because it happened to the time slice right before me in the region right next to me and the volume around me. So, these are all examples of structured data and multi-level models let you say more about the data. We can estimate the variation on all levels of the model and with the multi-level structure, we can also say, well, what if I have a new group. And then I can say well I don’t know what you know, I don’t know anything about the items in this new group. But if I know about the items in other similar groups, I can reason about unseen groups. And what you find though is once we start building these multi-level models, your big data suddenly isn’t so big anymore because you’ve put all of these qualifiers on every data observation and this makes working with a multi-level model both more interesting and more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2130-regression-models-in-r--brief-recent-history-of-bayesian-programming-languages&quot;&gt;21:30 Regression Models in R &amp;amp; brief recent history of Bayesian programming languages:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the history of regression models in R. From somebody who spends most of her time programming in C++ and Python is like this. We have the pre-existing packages. By preexisting, I mean pre-Stan which are LM and GLM for linear models and generalized linear models which handle single level linear models. And these are part of the base are statistics package and then you have lme4 which is designed to handle higher hierarchical linear models. The goal of the Stan Project which was started in 2010 was to build a better lme4. Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill in 2006, 2007 put out a really fabulous book “Multi-level Regression”, “Regression Analysis in Hierarchical Models”. I forget what the exact title is. It’s in a subsequent slide. What’s really interesting about that book is that in Gilman and Hill, they present a lot of data sets with lme4 syntax and our code actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fact of the matter is that those models can’t really be fit with lme4. It doesn’t really do the right thing on the data and Andrew’s point was that this is what I want lme4 to do. So, then if you later he hired some post docs to build a better lme4. And the result was the Stan probabilistic programming language and the NUTS-HMC algorithm which gives you a much more efficient way of doing Monte Carlo, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers, but that’s not what this talk is about. So, all I can say is we use on the back end and Stan fits your model using back-end algorithm which for the best inference is going to be NUTS-HMC. And the problem is that Stan was designed by computer scientists and so the Stan probabilistic programming language while it builds on BUGS has been relatively challenging for statisticians to work with. It’s a programming language. It looks a bit for both and it’s difficult to actually code up a model that does what you think it’s going to do. It’s very easy to put bugs in your BUGS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUGS by the way, BUGS stands for (Bayesian Uncertainty Under Gibbs Sampling). And when I tell this to non-statisticians who’ve never heard of BUG, they think it’s really the best name for a programming language ever. But BUGS basically really changed the course of Bayesian modeling. It made it very easy for people to write down their models because prior to BUGS, you had to write not just your model but your Gibbs samplers. So, that really set it for a pretty high bar for people who wanted to do Bayesian data analysis. With BUGS, Bayesian data analysis really took off and Stan I think has helped everybody brought it along another order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, BRMS was developed in about 2016 by Paul Berkner and the goal was to simplify model specification to relieve statisticians of the need to write stand programs. Instead, it appeals to our users because it uses lme4 style formulas and R-functions to wrap Stan. So, you can work in R, but you get the goodness of Stan and the comfort of thinking about your models in a way that if you were used to using lm, glm or lme4, a way that you’re used to if you’re a data analysis doing statistical modeling in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that RStanARM is a package which gives you precompiled Stan models and it’s similar to BRMS and Spirit in that with RStanARM, if there’s a package that you’ve been using in R for a particular kind of model, RStanARM probably has a version of that model that has a precompiled Stan model on the back end and that will probably do a better job of analyzing your data than the package that it’s replacing. And by better, I mean it will be faster and it will scale to larger data sets. So, this is sort of the landscape of packages and so when I talk about BRMS to the R-Ladies, I’m hoping that most of you are going to be relatively familiar with working with of regression package in R. but if you’re not, please stay tuned. I’ll show you how it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2722-linear-regression&quot;&gt;27:22 Linear Regression:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear regression, this is just a quick review of linear regression. So, and I’m got this slide here because I just want everybody to sort of be really clear on the terms that I’m going to be throwing around when we get to the notebook. So, we’ve got a linear model. We specify the linear model. In linear regression, we’re trying to fit a line to or multiplane or a multiplane to some set of observations. And the definition of a line isn’t intercept with the slope, and there’s some amount of noise. If we assume that this noise is independent for every observation, then we’ve got the guts, we’ve got the specification of a linear model. So, the linear model is written where we say that every observation YI is drawn from a normal observation which is centered at α β alpha plus beta times XI with variance sigma. So, sigma is that error term that we see in the formula above in the equation in the first equation and alpha plus beta XI is our linear predictor, sigma is the variance term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2852-generalized-linear-regression&quot;&gt;28:52 Generalized Linear Regression:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a generalized linear regression, we’re going to kick it up a level. So, instead of assuming a normal distribution, we can use any distributional family. And I’ve bolded family because you’ll see, well, actually, you won’t see but family is what you specify when you’re using glm package or the lme4 package or BRMS to talk about some other distribution. So, you can talk about a beta distribution, a Poisson distribution if your data is discreet Poisson. And the variance parameter sigma when we’re talking about a normal distribution is going to be any family specific parameter Theta. And we can generalize our linear predictor alpha plus beta XI to Ada, which we just mean any linear predictor. And we transform our linear predictor by an inverse link function so that’s where we’re getting the generalized linear modeling, that’s our link function coming into play. And then we can use group level subscripts on our parameters to allow for the structure in the data to make our model multi-level or hierarchical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, given all of that, we just have the equation specification for general multi-level model which says that YI is drawn from some distributional family and we have R-function, our inverse link function applied to our linear predictor Ada and there should an XI there in that subscript, but there isn’t. And we have some distributional parameters, Theta. But what we really are going to be talking about when we’re working with BRMS and thinking about the models that we’re fitting in BRMS are the intercept and the slope terms in our linear predictors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3105-regression-formula-syntax-in-brms&quot;&gt;31:05 Regression Formula Syntax in BRMS:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is the regression formula syntax. This is the very first example I had in that first call to the BRM function in BRMS. Reaction is distributed with according to an intercept term and the number of days and actually I don’t even want to try to explain what this guy is saying. I just want you to observe that this is a formula that on the left-hand side we have reaction, and on the right-hand side, we have a specification for our linear predictor. And in the linear predictor because we’re building a multi-level model. We have things which are population level terms, fixed effects and those are parameters where we don’t differentiate. They’re the same parameter for every observation no matter what group membership it might have in the structure of the data whereas group level terms which are sometimes called random effects vary by grouping factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’re going to start putting subscripts on our parameters to talk about which group a parameter is applied, being applied to. And in BRMS, we have these group level terms where we say coefficients vertical bar group. By coefficients, we mean the terms in the linear predictor. So, if you think of the intercept is being the first column in your design matrix or your set of predictors, the intercept term is just designated by one and everything is going to be designated by the column label that it has in the predictor in your data frame which is your set of predictors. So, here in this sleep study which is where this example comes from. One of the columns in the sleep study data is labeled reaction. One of the columns is day, one of the columns is subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;So, when we say (1+Days&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;subject) what we mean is that the subject is the grouping factor and we’re going to see that both the intercept term and the days, the slope of the days are varying with the grouping factor. I hope that wasn’t too confusing and we’ll show a whole bunch of examples when we get to the notebook.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3433-brms-processing-steps&quot;&gt;34:33 BRMS Processing Steps:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What BRMS actually does is quite impressive. BRMS is writing a Stan program for you. So, you just call the BRM function and to call the BRM function, you specify your formula, you specify your data, you specify your distributional family if it’s not gaussian by default, and you can specify all kinds of priors. Prior specification is a whole talk in and of itself. So, I’m not going to say anything about priors here. You specify all of these things and then, the BRM call feeds all of that into make Stan code and make Stan data then so it generates a Stand model using the Stand, a model written in the stand probabilistic programming language. That is then going to have to be compiled to C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the model code, the data, and all sorts of additional arguments which BR BRMS is putting into your call are passed to a back end. The back end can be either cmdstanr or it can be RStan, but you should probably be at this point using cmdstanr. It’s the modern interface, the modern R interface to stand. It’s more robust and it supports the latest version of Stan and it’s more scalable. I mean, for it can handle bigger models and more data. But otherwise under the hood it’s all Stan goodness. It doesn’t matter if you like to use our Stand, keep using RStan. The model is compiled and fitted in Stan and then BRMS does post processing and post processing is reversing a lot of the magic that goes into compiling up writing that Stan model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, it’s translating all of the names of things that are fit inside the Stan model, back to the names that you specified when you in your formula and are used in your data set. And then all the results can be investigated using all sorts of our methods in the BRMS package or the bayesplot, projpred or loo package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3713-notebook---link-to-online-notebook-and-data&quot;&gt;37:13 Notebook - link to online notebook and data:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whoa, there should be a link to that notebook but don’t worry, we are going to now jump into the demo part of the live demo part of this talk. So, this is the notebook in my screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3738-demo---in-markdown-rmd&quot;&gt;37:38 Demo - in Markdown (.rmd):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if putting it into full screen mode will make it bigger. I hope so. So, I’m just going to work through this little, our markdown document. So, the first thing we’re going to do is do some stuff that I always put into a notebook. And we’re going to load all the packages that you might want. I not actually using ggplot2 in this notebook, but never hurts to have ggplot2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3818-load-packages-readr-ggplot2-brms-bayesplot-loo-projprod-cmdstanr&quot;&gt;38:18 Load packages (readr, ggplot2, brms, bayesplot, loo, projprod, cmdstanr):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’re going to load the BRMS, the bayesplot, the loo, the projpred, and cmdstanr. Although, you probably don’t need to load. Well, I don’t know if you need to load cmdstanr. So, we’re going to load everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3838-book--arm&quot;&gt;38:38 Book – ARM:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book that Andrew and Jennifer wrote in 2006 is “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel Hierarchical Models”. Andrew refers to that as by short hand as ARM applied regression modeling. It’s a really great book and it makes a lot of things very clear if you’re at all interested in a really lucid discussion of causal inference. I highly recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3907-example---multilevel-hierarchical-model-with-epa-radon-dataset&quot;&gt;39:07 Example - Multilevel hierarchical model (with EPA radon dataset):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the example that they wait till chapters 11 &amp;amp; 12 to get to actual multi-level hierarchical models. And one of the first example data sets they use is the radon level dataset, which is a dataset that I did my previous talk on and in the chat earlier, there’s a link Lubliana lecture that’s more digging into what’s going on with that particular dataset. Which is an old historical dataset that’s mainly of interest to play around with hierarchical models. So, this was a national level survey. Andrew and Jennifer analyze data for the state of Minnesota, which consists of 919 measurements from residential houses from 85 counties. And the measurements were taken either in the basement or on the ground floor and although it’s not entirely clear, I’m pretty sure that if the house had a basement, the measurement was taken in the basement. So, the only times that a measurement would have been taken on the ground floor in a house is if there no basement. And another EPA data set provides the soil uranium level for each county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4032-further-description-of-radon&quot;&gt;40:32 Further description of radon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is this interesting? Radon gas is a carcinogen that happens to be particularly deadly if you’re a smoker. So, if you’re a smoker and you have a house that has a basement and you’re living in the basement and there’s no better ventilation, your chance of contracting lung cancer somewhere along the way goes up really astronomically. So, nowadays, modern building codes and general awareness of radon has made this much less of a problem. Thanks in part to this EPA activity in the 1990s. So, radon gas comes from the ground. It’s a byproduct of uranium decay. Uranium is radioactive and it has a very very long half-life, decaying slowly. One of those products of uranium decay is radon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4137-regression-model&quot;&gt;41:37 Regression model:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the regression model is going to try to predict the home radon level on the log scale. Based on the county in which the house is located, the floor on which the measurement was taken and the amount of soil uranium for that county. So, the data looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4202-demo---data-example&quot;&gt;42:02 Demo - data example:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the floor, the county name, the amount of data, the log radon level, the log uranium level which as you can see is uniform across the county, and the county ID which is a factor which will be very useful when we’re trying to group by county ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4226-3-modeling-choices&quot;&gt;42:26, 3 Modeling Choices:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the modeling choices that we have, to completely pull all the data across the state of Minnesota. So, we’re going to do a single regression, average home radon level in Minnesota is based on all 919 observations. Or we can try to use county information and a stupid model is the no-pooling model where we run 85 separate regressions to estimate the home radon levels by county. So, we just say as much data as I have on a county, that’s as much data as I’m going to use to figure out what’s going on in that county and then we have partial pooling, a multi-level model. Counties are similar. So, we’re going to build a multi-level regression which says that we’re going to share information across all counties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every county, we estimate what’s going on in that county, but at the hierarchical one level up we say that all counties are drawn from a distribution for that is a county distribution. So, that there’s a certain amount, there’s a certain location that we expect, certain set of parameters that are common hyper parameters in the model. Which say that, okay, for any county in Minnesota we sort of expected to have this general characteristic. We expect a certain radon level and we expect a certain amount of variants across the county and given that hype, that set of hyper parameters, then we’re going to estimate what’s going on in each individual county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4431-choice-1---complete-pooling-model-simple-linear-regression-formula&quot;&gt;44:31 Choice 1 - Complete Pooling Model (simple linear regression formula):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the complete pooling model is just a simple linear aggression formula. And so, in BRMS, the BRM function, all we need to do, the first argument to the BRM function is the formula. The formula is very simple here and the data set is the Minnesota radon data set. So, we can just run that and what going to happen? Well, actually we’re going to see a little bar. Right now, this is the C++ compiler compiling the generated Stan code. As soon as it’s done compiling it, this model runs like lightning because it’s a really, really, really simple model and it runs four chains using the NUTS-HMC sampler and then, it gives us the summary of how well it fit that model. So, for this gaussian family that works and we’re just doing the simple the not simple but we’re doing yeah, we are doing a simple linear regression where we expect everything to be distributed normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the identity, the links here. This is your generalized linear model links where we’re using the identity function for both the MU and the sigma of the gaussian. The formula is log radon is distributed according to the floor. The level on which the measurement is taken and we have estimate for the models intercept and for the floor. And this all makes perfect sense because the way that things are coded, the basement is coated as floor zero and ground floor is coded as floor one. And we know that radon gas, the levels of radon gas increase the lower you go in a building. So, we expect the slope of the regression line to be negative. Meaning, that if you’re in the basement, your radon level will probably be higher than if you’re on the ground floor and there’s a certain amount of variants here. That’s our sigma parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can visualize what’s going on by using the BRMS conditional effects on (fit_complete_pool). And that is going to give us a beautiful plot. The floor is actually discrete. So, it’s either zero or it’s one, but here you see the regression line in blue and the amount of uncertainty that’s about the 50% interval around the regression line in dark gray. So, if you’re in the basement, your log radon level is going to be higher than if you’re taking the measure on the ground floor, and this confidence that the uncertainty grows because we have far fewer measurements which are taken on the ground floor. Pretty much 80% of the measurements in this data set were taken in the basement. Because in Minnesota, most homes that were in the survey had basements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4822-choice-2---no-pooling-model-not-ideal&quot;&gt;48:22 Choice 2 - No Pooling Model (not ideal):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The no pooling model looks kind of silly because it’s silly. So, what we’re doing here in this formula is we’re saying there is no general intercept and that is because for each county we’re going to have its own intercept. So, we can fit that model too. And again, we can see that BMS has generated the Stan code and C++ is compiling the Stan code, takes a few seconds to do that. Takes like zero time to run the model and now, we get oh yeah. So, if we look at this, let’s look at this in the output window. Oh no, we definitely want to look at this here. This is so beautiful. This is the conditional effects plot for when we have 85 separate intercepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve got a linear regression model and if we go up to the previous one of these guys, here we see if we pull all of the data, we only have a single regression line. Here, we’re saying that we’re going to still use the floor as the slope of the line and we’re having 85 different intercepts. So, we get 85 different beautiful lines that are all parallel and I think this is just really fabulous. This is also a really stupid model and you don’t want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5017-choice-3---partial-pooling-model&quot;&gt;50:17 Choice 3 - Partial Pooling Model:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s move on to the first model which we say that we want to have a partial pooling model where we’re going to pull information between counties but for every county, we’re going to estimate its own intercept. So, this is what the formula looks like in BRMS and now we can fit this model. And when we’re done fitting the model, again, it takes the thing that takes the longest when running BRMS is just the C++ compiler translating your model to C++. Because the C++ compiler is doing a lot of optimizations so that your resulting model will run will be performant. And this plot the base plot MCMC interval plot here we’re just plotting the county level the estimates for the county level regression parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have 85 different parameters, one per county and what’s going on in this plot which is not actually that easy to read, because there are 85 things is that four counties which have a lot of observations, we get much tighter 50% intervals around the estimated mean. And in this data set, there are very few counties in Minnesota where all the people live. They’re essentially the counties for the Minnesota, Saint Paul, and also for Duluth. The rest of Minnesota is really rural and so for most counties, you have three or four maybe five observations, which is why you want to be building a multi-level model because you need to pull your information across your regions. And then finally, we have the [INAUDIBLE WORD 52:26] which is the varying slope varying intercept model. Which says that, okay, for every county we expect that the floor effect, the slope might be different for that county as well as the intercept term. So, then we can fit this model and we can do exactly the same plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think we’re getting almost to 8 o’clock. I don’t know how much longer I have to talk here, but one more example and then we will be ready for questions. So, now the sampling is actually taking a little bit longer because this is a more complicated model. It has more levels. It has more parameters and it has more hard choices to make. So, if we look at what’s going on here, this plot doesn’t look that much. Well, actually it looks quite a bit different than this plot. Things are moving around and what we see is that the regression now is pulling ever more closer to the center, the means now are pulling more together. So, you’re getting more and more pulling especially down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can add in one more predictor. The “log uranium”, which is the same across all observations in the county. We can see what adding log uranium is going to do to this model. So, this is a varying slope varying intercept model adding in another predictor the log uranium and we don’t need to do anything on the county level for log uranium because log uranium is already on a per county level. Although you know play around with it by all means don’t take my word for it. See what happens if you add log uranium into this group level effects. And adding log uranium, does it change things? It does, yes. It pulls things way more towards the center. So, that’s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5621-reshama&quot;&gt;[56:21] Reshama:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, Mitzi. We have a question which is, how do you compare the different models?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5626-mitzi-morris&quot;&gt;[56:26] Mitzi Morris:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. Perfect question. Yes. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5626-qa---how-to-compare-the-different-models-run-loo&quot;&gt;56:26 Q&amp;amp;A - How to compare the different models? (Run loo):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, am I still sharing my R screen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[56:31] Reshama: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5632-mitzi-morris&quot;&gt;[56:32] Mitzi Morris:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So, now we’ve got, well, we’ll just go over here. We’re done with the notebook. So, thank you. This is the last, this should be the list, selling the notebook, so you’re going to add it yourself. So, we’ve now got these various fits, right? Now, if we say, now we’re going to run the loo function and so, what this is saying is that, you’ve asked me the right question. But we’re all going to have to together read the documentation for the loo package to understand what these estimates are doing and what it is saying is that, you know what? I’m not really sure. Let’s try it, a simpler one. The loo function is designed specifically to compare your models. So, the short answer to your question is you run loo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[58:19] Reshama: Hey, Mitzi. Another question is this RMD available on Git? I did link to your GitHub. Is this the same exact R markdown file that people can access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[58:33] Mitzi Morris: Oh yeah, I put it on my GitHub repo, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5835-reshama-okay-got-it-and-then-another-question-that-came-up-is-can-brms-be-used-for-non-hierarchical-data-structure-and-non-regression-type-of-analysis&quot;&gt;[58:35] Reshama: Okay got it. And then another question that came up is can BRMS be used for non-hierarchical data structure and non-regression type of analysis?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[58:51] Mitzi: It can definitely be used for non-hierarchical data structure. So, there are plenty of multi-level models which are not hierarchical and a non-regression, what do you mean by a non-regression type of analysis? The answer there is no. The package is about regression. And how to view the trace of the parameters. To view the trace of the parameters, we can do something like plot. And I think this will give you, yeah. What is that doing? Not so bad. There you get some nice trace plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;010000-qa---does-brms-have-options-for-checking-model-assumptions&quot;&gt;01:00:00 Q&amp;amp;A - Does BRMS have options for checking model assumptions?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reshama: Another question here is does BRMS have options for checking model assumptions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:00:07] Mitzi Morris: What do you, yes, definitely. That is all about the prior predictive checking. So, your model assumptions essentially are your priors and BRMS has functions for prior predictive checks and it has posterior predictive checks. And yes, checking your model assumption is very, very, very important and that’s really part of the cool stuff of the generated Stan code for BRMS. It anticipates that you’re going, it generates a Stan program that has everything you need to do the model checking and the posterior. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Richard Montes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;010100-qa-what-were-the-default-priors-student-t-distribution-with-3-degrees-of-freedom&quot;&gt;01:01:00 Q&amp;amp;A What were the default priors? (Student T-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it’s not in scope, but curious what priors were used. These are the default priors. The default priors here are a student T distribution with three degrees of Freedom and Paul Berkner works a lot with Akivatari, one of the key Stan developers. Key contributors, coauthor of Bayesian Data Analysis and he’s very interested in the effect of the priors. And so, you can specify whatever prior makes sense and there are a lot of different theories about what a good prior firm model is. The prior really depends on your data. So, you shouldn’t rely on the default priors but the default priors are chosen to be very robust. And over the course of the time that the Stan project has existed, we’ve learned so much more about how these models behave, because we can fit more complex models with more different kinds of data and with larger datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned a lot about the behavior of what priors are good. And the difference between Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the HMC algorithm that is used by the Stan MCMC sampler and the pre generation of MCMC samplers, the Gibbs samplers is that for Gibbs sampling, you had to choose certain kinds of priors just so that the Gibbs sampler didn’t fall over and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm behaves very differently. So, there was a lot a lot of discussion and investigation that’s gone into what makes a good prior. And what is recommended as a good prior for a model has changed a lot from say 2007 when Gelman &amp;amp; Hill use all sorts of interesting priors in that text to now. And the priors are specified that Carlos wants to know how the priors are specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura, I’m really sorry. I don’t know how you can use this in Excel, but Carlos wants to know how the priors are specified. The priors are specified via an argument to the BRM function and you create something called BRMS prior object. So, the BRMS documentation will tell you everything you need to know about how to specify your priors and there’s several exam and vignettes in the BRMS documentation that should help you. They’re written by academic researchers. They have a certain flavor but if you look around and ask questions on the Stand discourse, you should be able to do just fine. Anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:04:47] Reshama: Last call for questions if anybody has any questions. Meanwhile, I’ll read some of the comments which is thank you for the great talk. “Thank you, Mitzi. This was an incredibly approachable introduction”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:05:02] Mitzi Morris: So glad to hear it. Thank you all. Great questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:05:13] Reshama: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:05:15] Mitzi Morris: Oh, oh, oh, I want to share one more thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:05:07] Reshama: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:05:18] Mitzi Morris: My final slide. I think I need to go to slide 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;010527-references&quot;&gt;01:05:27 References&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these are everything that you should read next. So yeah, take a screenshot and check out some of those URLs and the slides and the notebook are up on GitHub for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[01:05:57] Reshama: Mitzi, thank you so much for the excellent talk. Everybody, thank you for joining us and the video will be available very soon. Have a great evening, morning, wherever you are. Bye everybody and thanks Dorota.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication. The system has support for reproducible embedded computations, equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layouts, and more. In this talk we’ll explore the use of Quarto with Python, describing both integration with IPython/Jupyter and the Quarto VS Code extension. Users can author Jupyter notebooks or documents as plain text markdowns with code in Python, R, Julia or Observable. Quarto includes the ability to publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, Reveal.js and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, everybody! Welcome to Data Umbrella’s Webinar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am unfortunately unable to share my video today because it’s been over 85 degrees Fahrenheit in New York and that impacts my internet access at times, so no video today, sorry about that. I’m going to do a brief introduction and then Thomas is going to do his presentation. And anytime during the talk you can ask questions, but we’ll answer the questions. Thomas will answer the questions at the end of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is being recorded and will be placed on the Data Umbrella YouTube. Data Umbrella - if you’re unfamiliar, we are a community for underrepresented persons in data science and we are a nonprofit organization. This is our team who makes it all happen behind the scenes. We’re dedicated to providing harassment free experience for everyone and we thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various ways to support Data Umbrella. The first and foremost is to follow our code of conduct. We’d love it if you could share Data Umbrella events with people in your network and let them know about it. And we have some open source initiatives as well. We have Video Time students where we do timestamps of all of our videos and that helps users find our content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a website which is not on Quarto, I’m sad to say it is using JavaScript, but maybe we’ll change that. We also have a Sprint website for PyMC and scikit-learn and our blog and our events board is as well open source. 
Another way you can support Data Umbrella is to donate to our nonprofit. We’re an open collective and if your company uses Benevity for company match donations, that’s an option as well. This is just a sampling of some of our videos on our YouTube. We have a playlist for career advice and we have other playlists for data visualization, data Science for beginners, and a lot of open source. We focus a lot of open source and data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a monthly newsletter which is at dataumbrella.substack.com. It’s really just once a month if we have the resources to do it. So we won’t send you any spam or sell your email address. Actually, I’m going to skip over this one. If you want to scan in the QR code, this gives you all of our most used links. Our Meetup Group is the place to find out about upcoming events. YouTube is our videos, our newsletter GitHub is our open source projects and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use big marker for this platform, so at the very top you’ll see CC which stands for Closed Captioning or Live Transcripts. So feel free to if you’d like to see Live transcript, pick the language of your choice. I do hear that English is the most accurate, but you can try the other languages if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a feedback form which I’m going to share in the chat. But if you have any suggestions for future event topics, if you have any technical issues you want to communicate, if you would like to speak at an event, let us know. Our upcoming events on July 25th we’re having Machine Learning visualization using Yellow Brick, which is an open source library. And on August 8th Mitzi will be presenting on tracking the COVID-19 Challenge accounting for Missing Information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s talk is reproducible publications with Python and Quarto. Tom is a product manager at Posit. I actually can’t read the rest because it’s covered, but for the work I’ll let Thomas introduce IDE products. He was formerly a product manager in the Quarto team. And you can find Thomas Mock on GitHub at ‘jthomasmock’ or Twitter ‘thomas_mock’. And with that I am going to hand over the mic and screen share to Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thomas-mock-0414&quot;&gt;Thomas Mock 04:14&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much Reshama for the introduction and for having me here today. Can you confirm you see my screen okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-0421&quot;&gt;Reshama 04:21&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thomas-mock-0422&quot;&gt;Thomas Mock 04:22&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. I’m going to share my slides in the chat so you can get them there. And then the URL is also here on the screen at Thomasmock.quarto.pub/python-umbrella. As Reshama mentioned, I’m a product manager here at Posit. I manage the Posit workbench in RStudio IDE and Platform. So definitely a lot of love for the data science community and using IDES to do better reproducible data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as far as Quarto, this presentation will be about 35 slides or slow and really focused on a broad overview with some deep dives on specific topics, but really doing this kind of overview of what Quarto can do and how it might be interesting for you. Feel free to ask questions in the chat and I’ll get to those at the end of today’s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I always want to mention is people may have not heard the name Posit, but you might have heard of the name RStudio. So RStudio is a public benefit corp and we recently became Posit as another company name as a rebrand. And we are still a public benefit corp. We mainly went through this rebrand so that people are aware that while we still are investing in tools for R and tools like RStudio, that for a long time we’ve also supported languages like Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why part of why I’m giving this presentation today is talking about how Quarto is this multilingual tool for R, for Python, for Julia, for JavaScript and for future data science languages as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;as-far-as-what-is-quarto-0555&quot;&gt;As far as what is Quarto? 05:55&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one. If you’ve ever heard of things like our markdown, Quarto could be thought of as like the next generation of our markdown. But again, this language agnostic idea, if you were to ask the Quarto team, they would say something like Quarto is an open source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So importantly, this includes things like computation, so you can use data science languages like Python, R, 
Julia, or even Observable JavaScript directly inside the notebook document itself. You can also write or mark up or mark down the kind of structure via Pandoc flavored markdown with a lot of enhancements that are provided through Quarto. And then you can create all sorts of different outputs. So from a single source you can create a document, a presentation like today that I’m giving that was created in Quarto entire websites, blogs, books, even manuscripts that you can submit to journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s a literate programming system in this tradition of things like Org-Mode or Weave.jl, R Markdown, [iPyPublish], Jupyter Book, et cetera, where there’s lots of different kind of frameworks, and we’re trying to add to this community and combine a few different things where you have multiple languages available for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;origins-of-quarto-0713&quot;&gt;Origins of Quarto 07:13&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the origins of where Quarto came from, it is an open source project sponsored by Posit Again, formerly known as RStudio Public Benefit Corp. So if you’re trying to figure out where we came from, that’s our history when we were founded over a decade ago. We have over ten years of experience with the R Markdown Open Source framework, which is a similar system to Quarto, but that was very R specific. Overall, though, this decade of experience with it convinced us that a lot of the core ideas were sound and could be applied to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realized that, of course, the number of languages and computational runtimes that are used for science are very broad. And it’s not just R, it’s not just Python, it’s not just Julia or JavaScript, it’s some combination across all these different ecosystems. So Quarto is really this ground up reimagining of our Markdown modernized and made, multilingual and multi-engine so that you can use whatever language you want with it and have a consistent framework that is used across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarto absolutely gets inspiration from our Markdown as well as the Jupyter ecosystem. It can actually work directly with plain text documents like our Markdown, but we call them Quarto documents, as well as Jupyter notebooks in the IPython notebook structure itself. This overall goal, though, for Quarto is this computational document. So a document that includes the source code that creates it, as well as having a notebook format and a plain text flavor. We’re really big fans of plain text, but there’s lots of people who want to use, say, a Jupyter notebook or an IPython notebook as their entry point into Quarto, and that’s absolutely supported as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, you want to be able to use quarto to extend further, to make it either more reproducible or better automate and have things like parameterization and programmatic automation and generation of your reports or documents that you’re creating. When we think of moving beyond just a computational document, though, we want to have support for things like scientific markdown. Of course, you get started in something like Word. And if you’re trying to create these technical documents, you hit this really big learning curve and it’s hard to do all of the things you want there, or it requires a lot of fiddling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’re like, okay, well, maybe I’ll switch to LaTeX. And it’s like you start using LaTeX and you’re like, wow, this is really hard to get started with. Really powerful, but maybe it’s hard to collaborate with others on. And then you realize that even for something like Markdown, it’s relatively easy to get started, but there’s some unsupported syntax that you’re trying to do more with it. It’s not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Quarto is trying to get the best of all these worlds, of as easy to use as Word, as powerful as things like Law, Tech and Markdown, but in a cohesive format that you can use across with computation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then lastly, there’s a goal of this single source publishing. So at the most basic, Quarto can be used to create manuscripts and scientific communication. But you can also take a Quarto document and create again, a presentation, a website, a blog, all sorts of different things. And you can use that to have reproducibility across your publishing pipeline, as well as creating useful outputs beyond just a PDF or just an HTML, but really all these different formats all at once if you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as what Quarto looks like and getting into some of the meat of it, here’s a simple example using some Python code and a basic Quarto Markdown Document or a doc QMD. On the right, before we jump into the code, we can see a Matplotlib output. So this is what the rendered document would look like in HTML. It’s got a nice title, it’s got a hyperlink to the figure there, and it actually hides the code behind an expandable section where you can show the code or hide the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quarto document is actually made up of a few different components though. So you have the front matter, which is YAML Markup, and this allows you to define things like the title, the format you want to create, whether it’s HTML or PDF or other kind of syntax you want to use, and then the specific language or engine you want to use. So here I’m using Python 3, and I’m using that via Jupyter as a Jupyter kernel to power the document itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve defined that, you can then start writing your markdown, but it’s enhanced markdown. So of course you can do bold, you can do hyperlinks, you can do italics and headers and things like that. But you also see here we have at fig-polar, and that’s actually what defines the hyperlink to this image that’s created with Matplotlib afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So beyond the markdown, we also have support for computation via Python R, other languages, and you can write your exact Python code as you’d expect, create a graphic, but then have it referenced robustly by the rest of the document, and you have a figure caption, and you have it referenced in the text. And you can move across your document as you’re writing and actually incorporate all the different components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But importantly, you have those three structures, the YAML front matter, to define what is the document. I’m creating the markdown to actually write your text or your prose, and then code chunks that actually execute code like Python or R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that simple example was only HTML, but again, the goal here is that you could actually create many different formats. So Quarto, as a command line tool, can actually take something from your terminal and you could say, take this example, my hello world QMD, and render it to HTML or PDF or Docx or EPUB or PowerPoint, or a presentation like today with Reveal JS, so that same source could be used to create all these different formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can build for a very specific one, like if I’m building a website, I can optimize for a website, or if I’m building a PDF, I can optimize for a PDF. But ultimately, Quarto can convert to any of these different formats by using Pandoc under the hood, which is this document converter system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as what’s supported with Quarto, it’s a lot of different things. So this is relevant to what used to be possible with our markdown and what’s possible with Quarto today. So all these different formats like reports, HTML, PDF, Word, different types of presentations, whether it’s Microsoft Office and PowerPoint or Reveal, JavaScript style or LaTeX style, more complex manuscripts or scientific documents, entire websites, books, blogs, almost all the books we actually publish here at Quarto are actually made with Quarto books moving forward. So you can actually do robust publishing of entire books, both in print and on a website that goes along with them. So a lot of different formats you can create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s loop back, though, in terms of like, okay, so what is Quarto? It’s all these different things. It’s an open source scientific and technical publishing system. It’s built on Pandoc. Ultimately, Quarto, at the most basic is this language agnostic command line tool or command line interface. So from my command line on my MacBook or my terminal here, I can do something like Quarto – Help and say, what can I do with Quarto after I’ve installed it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll say something like, hey, you’re on this version one four. And there’s a number of different commands. And I’ve abbreviated the output here. But there’s three core ideas. I can render a document, so take a source document and render it to some type of output. I can preview a document which renders and then maintains a background web server to host the content. So I can make changes save and in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, those changes affect my presentation or my report, or I could even publish the document. And I can publish it to Quarto Pub, which is a free site that we maintain. Or you can publish to things like Netlify or even GitHub pages directly from the Quarto interface itself. So it’s not just the rendering, it’s not just the live interface and previewing, but even the ability to publish to external systems. We’ve even added things like Publishing to Confluence for enterprise usage or Publishing to Posit Connect for some of our enterprise customers, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quarto-basic-workflow-1527&quot;&gt;Quarto: basic workflow [15:27]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the basic workflow you write your document, you might use something like a plain text Quarto markdown document, and you could take something and do Quarto render python.qmd, and it will take whatever is defined in your YAML front manner and convert it to that format. You can also convert it over to a PDF, or you can say, oh, for this one off, I want to send it to a different format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, while I’ve talked a lot about plain text and .qmds, you can also take your existing unchanged IPython notebooks and render them as well and render them with Quarto. Importantly, there’s another option here, because Jupyter notebooks can actually store computation within the JSON structure behind the scenes, you can either take the existing render, basically the existing code for this notebook, and render it with Quarto, or you can re execute it linearly from top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Quarto markdown documents are linear and they execute top to bottom cell one, cell two, cell three, all the way down. With a Jupyter notebook, you might actually have executed them out of order, and you want to store that as is and just use Quarto to convert it to a different format, like a presentation or a blog post, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;render-vs-preview-1643&quot;&gt;Render vs Preview [16:43]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then also the difference between render and preview for this example is Preview executes it. It writes the output to disk, but it also maintains this web server. So like, let’s say when I was developing this presentation, I had Quarto preview running. So every time I made a change and click Save, I can see my results in real time and then be like, oh, oops, I messed up on this part. I need to make my bullet points a bit different or my code didn’t execute as I expected.  So there are these different options for both Quarto and for Jupyter notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ipython-1716&quot;&gt;IPython [17:16]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as executing code, Quarto uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; as the engine for R, but for Python, Quarto natively executes Python code with Jupyter kernels such as IPython, although you could define what other type of kernels you want to use. So the indicated or whatever the default Python kernel that is found or bound automatically is used whenever Python code chunks are present. And you can even define a specific kernel via the YAML header. 
So for this one, I’m using Jupyter. I’m explicitly saying, hey, use a Jupyter kernel and use this Python three kernel that has these specific packages that are alongside with it and again, because Quarto is a command line tool, you can even use it from within, say, a virtual environment that you’ve created to isolate your project specific libraries for that document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPython then goes through and executes all the Python code, transmits it to the output plain text, the graphics, the markdown, HTML, whatever output is necessary, and then Quarto bundles it all up into an output document or whatever resource you’re creating. And then for these interactive sessions where you’re kind of stepping through your code interactively, like, say, in Visual Studio Code or RStudio, Quarto actually keeps the Jupyter kernel resident in the background as a daemon to mitigate the startup time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically you don’t have to start up a whole new kernel. You can keep the kernel fresh as you’re making changes to your document. Importantly though, I do want to differentiate some of the design decisions that were made for Jupyter notebooks versus Quarto. Although both are fully compatible with Quarto as a tool, there are some differences in how they approach reproducibility or storing computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Jupyter natively approaches kind of storing the source code, the output file, and any caching in this single document. So the IPython notebook format is actually a JSON structure behind the scenes, and again, it stores some of the source code alongside the outputs that source code created. Jupyter cache builds on top of Jupyter to provide transient caching of specific cell outputs for a document. And if anything is changed in that, then it’s saying, oh, we need to re execute the whole document. So that’s available as well on top of Jupyter and its storing of outputs across the whole document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;storedfrozen-computation-and-reproducibility-1934&quot;&gt;Stored/frozen computation and reproducibility [19:34]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarto uses another technique called freeze. So this allows for a multi file approach. Quarto thinks of it as a source code, being you have a plain text Quarto markdown document or you have a Jupyter notebook, and those are just your source code. We’re not necessarily thinking about storing the computation inside of that, but just that it is the source code to generate your output. And you might have complete output files, something like an HTML or PDF that that is your separate output file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then your computation is stored as a computation structure, as pure JSON that allows you to permanently save and reuse these outputs across entire projects. Where someone might be using Jupyter, someone might be using Quarto, someone might even be using our markdown, and all of them can work together to publish a book or a website together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a couple different options there for all sorts of different things. Importantly, again, when we go through this, the Quarto markdown structure is a plain text file. So you have your metadata saying, what format do I want to create? What is my engine? Whether it’s R knitr or Python in Jupyter or Julia in Jupyter or JavaScript document, my code chunks. In this case, I’m using dplyr with R and I’m using polars in Python to do some group by summaries of the empty cars data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I have text or markdown that defines how I structure my document. I can add an image, I can add alt text for that image, along with headings and bold and italics text. So there’s a lot of different things here with writing this in a way where it’s still human readable even as it is now. But then we’ll talk a little bit later about the visual output you can create in real time in editors such as RStudio and Visual Studio code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quarto-doesnt-have-to-be-plain-text-2128&quot;&gt;Quarto doesn’t have to be plain text [21:28]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But importantly, Quarto doesn’t have to be plain text. And if you’re a Jupyter notebook super fan and you like using JupyterLab, you can actually use Quarto directly with that. So you can write in a Jupyter notebook, you can add a little bit of the front matter via YAML in the header as a raw code document, and then you can use from the terminal Quarto render to convert your Jupyter notebook into these beautiful outputs such as PDFs or HTML. 
We’ve even released a Quarto extension for both JupyterLab and for Visual Studio code that allow you to go even further beyond the basics and actually add on to the command line interface to provide editor specific tooling that I’ll show here in a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rendering-pipeline-2212&quot;&gt;Rendering pipeline [22:12]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the rendering pipeline, you can think of two options here I can have a plain text workflow where I use Quarto and I write all of my stuff in plain text. It still uses Jupyter kernels to execute things like Python. It converts this into an intermediary format and then eventually turns it into things like PDF or Word or websites. 
But if I know and love Jupyter, I can just stay inside a notebook workflow. So I can use Jupyter natively, whether a classic Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab, and then use Quarto to render it out and use the existing stored computation from within Jupyter. So there’s multiple options here, especially when you’re collaborating across folks. They might have differing opinions about what kind of structure they want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-do-with-my-existing-ipynb-2257&quot;&gt;What to do with my existing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.ipynb&lt;/code&gt; [22:57]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you might ask, okay, well, I actually really like Jupyter notebooks. Can I keep using them? Like, what do I do with my existing notebooks? Keep using them, like you get to choose whether to use that stored computation or again re execute with Quarto the document in a linear fashion. Importantly, you know, for some folks, you might be interactively exploring with a Jupyter notebook and execute code cell three, then code one, then two, then five, then four. You’re kind of playing around with it out of order and you need to store that computation to make sure it actually looks right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it might be more reproducible to execute it fully linearly, top to bottom, to make sure that if you executed it fresh, it would actually work in a programmatic fashion as opposed to interactive. So you do have this option of forcing execution or again reusing the stored computation from within the notebook from before. 
And importantly, let’s say that you might be collaborating or you want to swap. Quarto actually helps you convert from a plain text Quarto document into a Jupyter notebook and back and forth. And you can actually store both copies on disk at the same time by defining what the output you’re wanting to create is. But again, I just want to really emphasize you don’t have to use the plain text if you don’t like it, and you don’t have to use Jupyter notebooks if you’d prefer to use plain text. But Jupyter is a core part of the ecosystem, even with Quarto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what this really means is you get to choose and use the comfort of your own workspace, whether that’s something like JupyterLab, something like Visual Studio code with the Quarto extension that allows you to use either plain text notebooks or Jupyter notebooks within Visual Studio code. And you can even use it within our studio, whether you’re writing R code or Python code. Both of those can be done within our studio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve really tried to invest across ecosystems and across different editors and not just limit it to something like our studio, but provide these multi editor experiences across many different productive tools. We’ve even invested specifically for Visual Studio code with the Quarto extension to actually enhance the Quarto experience, make it similar to also what’s possible with our studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a lot of metadata you can define within, say, like the YAML header, and it might be difficult to remember all of what’s possible. So in our studio and Visual Studio code, you actually get rich auto completion of the options that are available. So you don’t have to remember everything. You start with format, then you say HTML, then you say, well, what’s today’s date? And you can define the date within that structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even within code chunks, you can actually define and have auto completion of the options for code chunks. So you can say, well, I want this code cell to execute this one. I’m just showing off code and I don’t want it to execute because it’s pseudocode, for example. So I can have evaluation on or off or show the code or not show the code. And all these different options that are possible have auto completion in both our studio and Visual Studio code. And more than that, the quarter extensions for both JupyterLab and for Visual Studio code allow for real time rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So within JupyterLab, when you actually execute the YAML, it’ll show you the proper heading as like a heading one, it says, the author was me. And then it keeps the formatting for the options there and then the code. And for Visual Studio code, we also have the Visual Editor that allows you to have a word processing like experience, where you can switch between plain text markdown and the actual rendered output in the actual editor itself. Even before rendering it out to a final document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can do things like bold add bullet points, format, insert pictures and tables, all sorts of things to make you more productive. And of course, in our studio, we have a similar experience with being able to switch between source mode and this visual mode where you have all this word processing that’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do see a couple of questions in the chat about scientific outputs. I’ll get to some of those at the end, but you might notice that there’s some opportunities here to include things like LaTeX or computational formula inside of the document and seeing those rendered in real time as well through the visual editor in Visual Studio code, as well as JupyterLab in our studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions I saw in the chat, and I’ll repeat it, know what are about the options of switching between formats. Like if I’m saying I’m outputting to Word and HTML, like HTML is really beautiful and really rich, but PDFs or Word is actually much more constrained in what you can create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this example I have a Boston terrier named Howard. I love my dog. So I have a quick example here of one of the Wikipedia articles about Boston terriers that I’ve converted over to a Quarto document. So of course I can take this article I’ve written, I can convert it over to HTML and get a beautiful HTML output, but I can also take the exact same document and convert it to PDF. And it also looks like a really good PDF. I can further optimize for either of those formats, but I can actually create these really beautiful outputs from this exact same source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the output of my Boston terrier article that is copied verbatim from Wikipedia in HTML. I’ve got nice hover text, I’ve got citations, I’ve got a scrollable table of contents, graphics in the sidebar and descriptions of those alternative text, all these great things. I really love this article. 
But then someone says, hey, I’m offline. I need to actually print out the PDF or take a look at it. Can you render a PDF for me as well? From the exact same source code, I can create a PDF version that still has the citations and the rich text and the structure of the document using the same source code. So from the exact same document, you can output to different formats and have a really, really nice output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is something really motivating for me because I like generating HTML. I don’t love creating PDFs, but some people need them or have to use them. So Quarto can make it easy to render to different outputs, all from the same thing. There’s even a format called Quarto Manuscripts that I’ll kind of share some of that at the very end on the Quarto website because it’s brand new, but it allows you to keep the source documents as well as a PDF as well as an HTML, and even this kind of Jax format where you can take the entire bundle of reproducibility and submit it to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that whole pipeline is where we’re trying to get to of like you don’t just have the PDF that’s on the scientific publication or in the journal, but you can also maintain a really nice HTML output that goes along with your kind of PDFs or your Word documents that are going out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again when you’re writing this syntax, I’ll give you a couple of examples of how we share formatting and syntax across both markdown and code. But let’s say I wanted to create two images side by side with a quick kind of what is this? So I can take Pandoc dive here, let me zoom in a little bit, and I can say, hey, for these two elephants that are historically known and written about, lay them out with two columns and put them side by side. And I take these images on disk, and I can create this kind of two column layout of the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that same syntax also applies to dynamically created graphics in Python or R. So here I’m using the plot nine library in Python, which is almost one to one with ggplot from R. And importantly, I create two separate graphics, plot one and plot two. I use the same layout-number of columns equals two, and it actually puts them side by side and it actually injects the figure captions appropriately. So this is a scatter plot, this is a box plot. Even though these were generated on the fly, I’m able to mark them up in a scientific format way or in a reporting way on the fly. So you can share the syntax across all the different structures that you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ultimately what we’re trying to do here is provide as much built in markdown centric format agnostic syntax as possible, as we’ve shown a little bit in the previous slides. Like we don’t want you to have to go off and create all this custom stuff. We want to bake all that in, batteries included. So Quarto bundles, bootstrap, as these really rich CSS themes for HTML, I respect SAS variables for even more robust styling dynamically across all the HTML formats. So documents, websites, books, slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also includes LaTeX templates for specific journals, where again, you don’t have to figure out how to write raw LaTeX, you can just take the Quarto markdown, use this specific template from this journal from LaTeX, and it will generate the correct PDF output for you, even if you didn’t know what LaTeX was. So you can again create these different multi formats for specific journals, and we’ve already had lots of people using those templates and adding to the templates over time for their specific journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, Quarto also respects Microsoft Office templates. So things like Docx or PowerPoint, where you can use a corporate theme allowing you to style the document robustly without having to inject weird XML inside the document. Although you can kind of generate intermediary markdown or LaTeX or XML outputs that you can then play with more in downstream formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately you shouldn’t have to escape out to writing raw LaTeX, HTML using Ginger templates or anything like that.  You can rely purely on the Quarto markdown syntax, but if you really, really want to optimize for a single format, you can use a template or you can even include your raw content to further style it and optimize for one specific format if that’s the way you want to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve even included the ability to extend quarto with open source extensions from the community and from us as well. So you might have things like short codes where you can inject like social media short links, or you can add moticons or other different things like that. You can apply filters that change the styling of specific items. So you can make your code chunk, say, hey, I’m referencing this file on disk, make it look like I’m actually reading from a file and then printing the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can even define your entirely new format. So for my company, I want to create a presentation format using Reveal JS, and I want to make it where every time I use those slides that it looks appropriate for my organization. So there’s a lot of ability to further enhance Quarto and then share those open source extensions with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to close out with two things and then we’ll get into questions. But I also want to call out that Quarto with HTML fully supports interactivity. So you can use Python packages or R packages to embed interactive graphics like Plotly and actually have those be fully interactive in both presentations as well as in websites or blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even more than that, we actually embed a version of JavaScript called Observable JavaScript that allows you to define net new interactivity on the fly. So here I have something that looks pretty similar to something like a shiny application or even like a streamlit application where you have like a graphic and then there’s a little slider bar here. And in real time I can modify the filtering step I want to do and show different things in my graphic and have it update in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also applies to tables where I can affect the table as well as a graphic in real time through these different components. This is done through, of course, IPython widgets or Jupyter widgets, as well as this ability to do it directly through JavaScript. So these on the fly widgets I want to talk about maybe something simple like this, where I say, oh, it’s 34 degrees Celsius. What does that actually mean for me? Because I’m weird and American and I use Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I know Reshama is saying it’s about 85 degrees Celsius in New York, which is about 30 degrees Celsius in the rest of the modern world. Or I can say, well in Texas it’s about 102, which is 39 degrees Celsius. So in real time I can have my document editable by the end user without having them to write R Python code on top of it. Now, this actually is pretty simple to do. I can use a OJS or Observable JavaScript chunk and then define an input range so zero to 100 step with a unit of one, the default was 34. And then say that it shows degrees Celsius, which is this HTML code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I can say for the output in the body of my document output, the temperature and the Fahrenheit and have those update in real time depending upon the temp that is changing up here. So just really want to call out that if you see something that you want to do that’s custom beyond what’s available in Jupyter widget, you can build these widgets on the fly and actually embed them into the body of your document and not just be stuck within a code chunk. So, really, really cool additional feature!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very last thing I’ll talk about and we’ll get into some summaries. But while you can create this one source and create many different formats, you can also take one source and create many different outputs. So from the same document I might show results for New York and for Texas, so a report for Reshama and a report for me, or I can run a report for 2022 versus 2023. Or I might just rerun a single analysis with different parameters for different assumptions that I’m doing for my analyses. And I can do these parameterized outputs in both Python and R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for Jupyter, I use a paper mill style tag system where I can define specific tags as these parameters and do things like alpha or ratio that are then available at the top level environment. So they’re actually defined for the rest of it, but I can define them via Quarto and change them at the rendering process later on. And then for R you can define them in the YAML header and they’re actually stuck within a params list object, so they’re not pulled out into the top level environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, importantly, in both Python and R, there’s these rich support for parameterization of your documents. What this looks like in practice is at the Quarto render step, you might say Quarto render my notebook with these parameters and I can change the alpha value or the ratio value for my graphic or for my machine learning pipeline in real time just by rerendering the exact same document. Or for more complex pipelines, I can actually use an external YAML file that defines many different parameters all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine I have a lot of different things that are changing across a long document and I can actually generate many different versions of the same report from the same source code with different outcomes based upon changing these whole host of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this was a really broad overview of what Quarto can do for you. Hopefully some of that is motivating. And I know there’s some questions in the chat we’ll get to here in a little bit. The last thing I want to call out is for publishing, you can also publish Quarto documents and Quarto outputs to a number of different places. 
So Quarto Pub is a free resource that we provide. You can sign up for it at Quarto Pub and you can publish like a blog or different HTML outputs there. But we also have support for publishing directly to things like GitHub pages or to posit connect one of our commercial products or to Netlify for more robust presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I just want to say that Quarto being an open source product, is crafted with a lot of love and care and we really thank the community and all the different contributors and open source projects that help build this out. So thank you to everyone for allowing us to kind of aggregate all these different wonderful things. And if you do have feedback, you can always go to GitHub.com/quarto-devquarto-cli, and you can submit issues or feature requests there and commit or contribute to the open source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as some resources, I think in general Quarto.org is the best resource that’s actually all of the kind of public documentation and you can go there to learn even more and get started with installing it inside your system and working with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some videos that are linked to webinar style.  If you go to Thomasmock.quarto.pub/pythonumbrella for the actual URL, you’ll actually be able to see and I’ll drop that into the chat. Again, you can see these resources and interact with this to click on the links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that, I do want to answer a few of the questions, so I’m going to read those out loud and then answer them as best I can. So a question from Mani, thank you for this one. 
Can Quarto documents be shared like overleaf documents and related to that, can users import article templates, specific journals into Quarto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can use the specific journal templates. So if I go to the Quarto website, I go to guide, go to all formats, trying to think of where scholarly writing, there’s a whole section on using scholarly writing or publishing for specific journals specifically like to publish to trying to think of which one. This is for the Journal of Psycho Ceramics, which is that’s an interesting one, that’s exciting about silly String theory. It shows an example of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I go to journal so journal Articles talks about some of the supported formats. So ACM, PLOS ASA, Elsevier a lot of different ones, and if you don’t see one that you’d like, you can actually open an issue. And we can work on adding that template working with the Downstream Journal themselves, because often they create a LaTeX template that we then bundle and make work with Quarto so that you can again not have to write all this LaTeX to generate a PDF, but rather just deliver a Quarto document or a bundle. 
I also want to call out that this is relatively new, but I think Manuscript, I think it’s here. There’s a new manuscript option that again is the bundling of the entire project together where you might have HTML output, some Jupyter notebooks, some Quarto documents and a PDF that generates an entire website and that entire bundle can be shipped off to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some of that might actually be in the release notes for the pre-release because it’s a brand new. So Quarto Manuscripts if I go to get started more pre-release, there’s a Quarto Manuscripts page that again includes the other formats where you’re generating word PDF as well as this mecha bundle that’s kind of the aggregation of all the resources. And then you have the source notebooks that actually generated this manuscript and you can link out to external resources like a GitHub repository that has the live source code there as well.  So again, we’re really working towards this future of robust scientific publishing via Quarto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-great-question-from-wasani-which-is-is-it-git-friendly&quot;&gt;A great question from Wasani, which is: Is it Git friendly?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that’s an important aspect of plain text versus Jupyter is at the basic level, plain text operates really, really well with source control like Git. Jupyter notebooks and the JSON can be a bit trickier to work with source code, but there are some extensions that allow you to use source code like Git and GitHub with Jupyter notebooks. But at a basic level, the way I like to think about it is plain text will work for sure, like you can make line by line changes without changing the entire structure.  So it’s a really robust option, especially when you’re collaborating via source control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-from-jordy-is-has-quarto-already-been-used-in-published-scientific-work&quot;&gt;Question from Jordy is: Has Quarto already been used in published scientific work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some gallery examples. So on Quarto.org under Gallery you can see there’s a lot of different things for articles and reports. I think some of these include some presentations and other scientific articles, but this would be a good resource for seeing how you might get started. And there’s even community resources. I want to say there’s a lot of blogs and places here, some books that we have published or working on publishing via Quarto in Python and R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a lot of resources here to see how others have approached using Quarto for really, rreally robust outputs and entire books that are used for classes, for physical publication. Even some of the books I have on my shelf written that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-question-from-corey-any-general-suggestions-for-outputting-to-docx&quot;&gt;A question from Corey: Any general suggestions for outputting to docx?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML provides such a rich output, but the word output can be more difficult to achieve. So importantly, I talked a little bit about that when I was showing the PDF versus the HTML output. But with the guide you can actually see documents and then Microsoft Word and Word templates by referencing this external reference doc that defines all of your styles. You can again use that to define all of the XML that’s specific for Word. And you don’t have to think about XML, but you’re really creating like a Word template that Quarto then knows how to respect. 
And similarly for HTML, your source document in Quarto could be the same for HTML and for Word, but they could look vastly different because you’re using a different way of theming it or reference template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;another-question-from-zhang-yoon&quot;&gt;Another question from Zhang Yoon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the presentation. Could you provide any tips on how Quarto can help a user who heavily uses the Quarto environment on a supercomputer? Can Quarto have the ability to see the output on the command line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there actually is a markdown format where you can always print the raw output as like a cat function to print it at the terminal as opposed to writing it out to a text file. But importantly, there are some tools for things like Slurm or other high performance computing environments where you could write things that are in Visual Studio code or workbench like that’s one of the things we do with Posit workbench is integrate with Slurm and Kubernetes and you can actually author directly in RStudio or JupyterLab or Visual Studio code, then executes the document remotely in the high performance computing cluster and brings it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-question-from-liz-about-github-actions-and-using-those-with-quarto&quot;&gt;A question from Liz: About GitHub actions and using those with Quarto.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can use GitHub actions or other continuous integrations with Quarto. So I’m just using the search here on the website to move around quickly. But you can publish to something like GitHub and then use Quarto render within a GitHub action to actually re execute the code, or in some examples, use the stored frozen computation. But build a website. You could imagine my collaborators are building a Jupyter notebook; I’m using a Quarto document. We hand off the code in the middle and we don’t want to re execute it because it was executed locally, but we just want to build it into a website like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s an example where continuous integration allows for local execution or for actually re executing it all the way inside, continuous integration. So there’s a couple of different options depending upon do you want to re execute R in Python or do you want to execute locally and just render remotely? So a couple options there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-from-rohail&quot;&gt;Question from Rohail:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is, is it possible to have a website where we have Quarto documents representing the posts, but I was wondering if it’s possible to have individual environments attached to each blog post with RN, Anaconda or other virtual environments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, you can have there’s a virtual environment section on Porto that allows you to talk about folder specific libraries. You can imagine that for a blog, what you actually have is a structure of the project root, and then within each blog post you have a specific folder for that blog post. So you can actually define a project specific library via something like RN or virtual end or even cond, I believe, at the project or folder specific level. That then allows you to have reproducible individual blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take a step back, though, you don’t have to use that. And you could use Managing Execution via Freeze that allows you to again store the computation locally. And even when you’re rebuilding your entire blog, you don’t have to re execute code from four years ago, but you can just execute the most recent document. 
This is what I use for my personal blog. So if I were to go to the mockup blog for my one, I’ve got a lot of blog posts, and if I go to the oldest one from 2018, every time I publish a new blog post, I don’t want to re execute this code from five years ago. I can just reuse that frozen computation and then it aggregates that into the overall blog itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even when I’m adding to this and doing more stuff and more blogging, I’m not having to potentially break my website or have to figure out how to manage old code. I just store the output from those in the past. I think that was all the questions. We’ve got about ten minutes remaining, so if you do have other Q and A, feel free to throw that into the question and answer. I’ll check out the chat real quick. Thank you for suggesting read the Q/A. I moved over to there, but yeah, let me know if you have other questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, I think the best resource is number one. My slides are publicly available and they’ll be up forever, and then Quarto.org has a whole host of documentation for all the languages that are supported out of the box. So Python, R, Julia, Observable JavaScript, and if you go to the guide or Getting Started, you can say, hey, I want to download the CLI and install it for my specific operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you say, well, what is the editor I want to use? Maybe I want to use a text editor in the command line. I can use that. Maybe I’m a Jupyter user or studio, Visual Studio code. If I click into that, it actually walks through creating a basic document, Getting Started, How Computations Work, installing Packages and Libraries, and the whole process of working with that. So a nice, friendly, getting started page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the guide goes into as much detail as you could ever imagine on all the different options, or as you saw me using the search bar up here, if I’m thinking of something like GitHub Actions, I can see oh, there’s a lot of different opportunities for GitHub Actions for publishing and I can go read about that specific topic without having to navigate the file directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s the bulk of it. But again, I’m around for a few more minutes and I’m going to just hang out and kind of talk for a little bit more. So if you have other questions, please ask them in Q/A. And thank you so much for the time today. The gallery as well is a real good resource for looking at examples of what others have done and especially around like I want to create HTML or PDF or these different presentations, you can get some kind of exposure to how others have approached it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun one I did with the Apache Arrow project around using it for really big data sets, for example, and I’ll show up some pictures of Boston Terriers because that’s always a good call and I love Boston Terriers. So you can find examples of different presentations from the Quarto.org website itself.
And even for some of the personal blogs or professional blogs like the nbdev project from Fast.AI, they’ve standardized around Jupyter notebooks for a long time, but they’ve recently started using Quarto to build websites and some of the documentation hosted via Quarto. So even the broader open source community is building on and around some of the use of open source products like Quarto in conjunction with Jupyter and GitHub and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, their blog here is a Quarto blog. You can see all the different options around it. They have a nice article about using nbdev with Jupyter with Quarto, which again is impactful for using Jupyter with version control. They’ve actually done a lot of work on making that better and able to safely check Jupyter notebooks into version control. Or you could use the Quarto Plain text markdown documents as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I don’t see any other questions. I’m going to pause for a little second, get a drink of water, but if others have questions, feel free to ask them in the chat. I’ll go back to Quarto.org, the last thing I’ll call out is with the Quarto blog. So again, Quarto.org blog, we talk about a little bit more about new things as they come out. And so you can see embedding or multi format publishing some of the exciting things as they come out summarized as opposed to reference documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, especially if you’re developing shiny applications with Python, there’s even support for Shinylive, which is a WASM or WebAssembly implementation of Shiny in Python that can be embedded into Quarto documents, where you can actually have interactive applications hosted directly inside your documents. So this will load for a second and I can have again these real time ability to modify components and develop Shiny applications that are then hosted within a Quarto document or a Quarto website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some really, really cool things that they’re working on. I really like keeping up with them through the Quarto blog as well as just checking in on the Getting Started release notes. You can always see the pre-release and they have some information they’re doing around support for other formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or again, I think the Quarto manuscripts is something that’s really, really cool. It’s in pre-release for one four, but this really robust bundle of assets for robust publishing and that it’s supported across the major editors so JupyterLab Visual Studio Code and RStudio and across document types, so Jupyter Notebooks as well as Quarto documents really kind of building upon this scientific publishing and communication aspect. 
I think Reshama is having a little bit of Internet trouble, so I just messaged her, but I think, oh, here we go. 
How can I use Quarto to write scientific papers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a nice section on the guide if you go to authoring here and then scholarly writing, it talks a little bit about using things like bibliographies or references and how you can embed those in the text and have things like hover text for specific articles in the HTML or even in the PDF output having the nice hyperlink to those. 
It talks a little bit about cross references where you might define a figure in maybe the first few pages, and then you can reference that figure much later in the document and have it actually link back to the original figure, as well as things like writing LaTeX for formula or theorems and proofs and having those robust to mathematical syntax inside the document itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of the books and other more complex things some of that also plays in, but especially for those types of like actually doing scientific writing. The scholarly writing section is really great. It’s a good start. I will go back and there’s even some information around citations, and you can have reference to your affiliation where you’re coming from, URL to your site and have the citation example where you have, like, a bibliography example for the article you just wrote, as well as other more complicated kind of structures where you’re using Google Scholar or different citation options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, well, so much. Thank you so much for the time today. It looks like Reshama asked me to just close this out and she’s going to use that to close out today. But we’re all wrapped up. Feel free to reach out to me. I’m on Twitter, I guess a little bit, although mostly on Fosstodon or on Threads at this point as we kind of figure out where the data community is moving to and kind of standardizing around. But feel free to reach out anytime and make sure to check out the Quarto.org documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to Data Umbrella for having me today and for y’all for attending. I’ll see you next time. Thank you so much. I’m going to close this out and concludes exit the webinar. And thank you and have a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-005&quot;&gt;Reshama 0:05&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Shani. Actually, first if you want to say your name is spelled Y-A-N-I-N-A. Do you want to say how it’s pronounced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-016&quot;&gt;Yanina 0:16&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sure. My name you can say Shanina how I will say my name, but it’s okay if you also say Yanina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-030&quot;&gt;Reshama 0:30&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! So trying to – let’s talk a little bit about how we met. How did we first meet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-036&quot;&gt;Yanina 0:36&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was because Code for Science and Society, we both got a grant from them and we share some of their meetings as grantees. And yeah, we chat there and we have the opportunity to know each other and then we just continue having meetings and catch up and sharing resources. So yes was in Code for Science and Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-110&quot;&gt;Reshama 1:10&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s true. And now I remember in June of 2021, Data Umbrella organized the Latin America scikit-learn Sprint and I had reached out to you to help spread the word and ideas on how to connect with the Latin America community. So you were very helpful with that. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-126&quot;&gt;Yanina 1:26&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-131&quot;&gt;Reshama 1:31&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So hang on. Okay, so to start, do you want to share what communities that you are a part of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-148&quot;&gt;Yanina 1:48&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, well, most of my involvement in international communities come from the R community, from the R world, the programming languages, and I start being part of R-Ladies as a very important community for me. And then I create some community in Latin America. For example, LatinR, which starts as a conference, but we believe that it’s a community. And then I also participate at rOpenSci, and now I’m the community manager of rOpenSci. And I have been part of other different groups related with R, like Minorities in R, RForwards and the people who organize other conference like UseR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, a lot of are in my life in the community aspect. And then more locally, I’m part of several community related with research and research software development. So some of them are professional association and other are also group of people who get together to do interesting things or things that we enjoy together here in Argentina. I’m based in Argentina in South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-322&quot;&gt;Reshama 3:22&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re also part of the Carpentries as well, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-324&quot;&gt;Yanina 3:24&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course I’m part of the Carpentry. More related with education and also yes, computational skills. I start as an instructor like we all do. Then I become a trainer and now I’m part of the executive council. And yes, I mostly teach in Spanish workshops and instructor trainers. So I try to teach people how to teach so they can do that also in Latin America in their native language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-359&quot;&gt;Reshama 3:59&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. Yeah. Teaching people how to teach has such a compounding impact, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-405&quot;&gt;Yanina 4:05&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. And the material that Carpentry have is so practical. It is based in evidence, but you can see an immediate impact in the way you teach. You can see the improvement. So it’s really nice when you have this science translate to action. And I think that carpentries do that very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-428&quot;&gt;Reshama 4:28&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So how did you first become when and how did you first become involved in the R community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-437&quot;&gt;Yanina 4:37&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was in 2017, I remember that because that same years I create Santa Rosa R-Ladies chapter here in my city. But the theme was through Twitter, actually. And I say we kind of sad because of what’s happening in that network. I leave Twitter some weeks ago, definitely, I mean, I stopped interacting several months ago and I just don’t log in anymore. But I was checking my timeline and I see a blog post from a person from Uruguay, Daniela Vasquez, and she talked about R-Ladies and how she get involved doing translations, how she co found Buenos Aires, R-Ladies chapter, the capital in my country. 
So I start follow her and I start to pay attention. And at some point, Buenos Aires has their first event. And I asked for the material of that event and they answered me, saying, here is the material. Do you want to create a chapter in your city? And I say yes. And that is how everything starts. So yeah, was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-559&quot;&gt;Reshama 5:59&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s worth accentuating that. A lot of people were connected through Twitter. Social media has had such a profound impact on it. By the way, I have an invite to Blue Sky if you would like it. So let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-614&quot;&gt;Yanina 6:14&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-615&quot;&gt;Reshama 6:15&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I’ll send it to you after this webinar, it’s really been instrumental in connecting people in the tech community. Why did you get involved in the community and how is it important to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-629&quot;&gt;Yanina 6:29&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, for me, I was a researcher for 24 years and in the institution that I work, what we call transfer and extension of science is a very important aspect. So we really value to bring the science we do to the people who will use it. And also the beneficiary of our research are part of our decision table. They are sitting the board of director at national, regional and local level. So we have this integration with the people who will use what we do.
And also, I’m a person who come from a humble home and I was able to get a university education because we have free and public education. So teach to other people computing skills. That is my degree. And the things that I do was a way to give back and was a way to people use what I was developing as a researcher. So I come from the computer science world and I build platform software and data products. So for me, it was important that that is useful, that really has a goal and a practicing use for the people in my city, in migration, in my country. 
And I found that community has a huge impact in that way. You can offer for free skills and knowledge and information firsthand an opportunity to your local community. So I think that it changed my life personally and I think that provide a lot of opportunity for a lot of people sometimes when you are in the global soul as I am and at that point in 2017 I didn’t speak English. So the way that you can access information, opportunities, collaborations are scars because you have a lot of barriers and the art community through R-Ladies at the beginning give me that. Give me a safe space to make mistake with my language. A safe space for made silly and I go to use this sign that is silly questions. 
Like they are not silly questions but sometimes you feel like oh my God, this is so basic. Should I be asking this? And have a safe space where you know that if you do this basic question, someone will answer you very happy to help you about that. And not only in things related with the language, but also about cultural things, about opportunities, about information, how I write a good grant, how I apply for a scholarship, how should I communicate this aspect of my life to the international community? 
So there are a lot of aspect, not only the computational skills. And because of this community, I reach several others. So I start to be aware about developments, about, for example, these teaching practices from Carpentries. And you start to have a more wide world, a more big world that you can be part. And then you start to realize that you can be as good at anyone there. So you can be part and you can contribute with useful contributions. I mean, you can be part of that. And sometimes that is not so clear for some of us. So yeah, I found in community a way to have a huge impact and sometimes a faster impact that you have in other kind of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1103&quot;&gt;Reshama 11:03&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you define community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-1107&quot;&gt;Yanina 11:07&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it’s a group of people who enjoy doing something and they get together to help each other to learn and to enjoy about that something they enjoy. And for me it’s very important the group aspect like a place where you feel okay, you feel part. For me belonging is important and that you feel important, you feel that people cares about you and you grow and as a professional, as impersonal aspect yes, a place where you can go not only to learn but to share and that you feel okay and you feel part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1200&quot;&gt;Reshama 12:00&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a great definition. So you belong to a lot of different communities. We can focus on the R community here. How do you contribute to the R (Rstats) community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-1213&quot;&gt;Yanina 12:13&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples yeah, my first contribution was to organize a chapter here so the people who wants to learn or share things about art can get together and share what they know. So here we organize meetings, sometimes we have only one meetings in the month and sometimes we have severals. For example, when we do workshops, that usually is four or five weekly meetings where we go through basic stuff or more advanced stuff, depending on the person who are going to deliver the workshop. 
Then the other things I want one of the co-founders of Latina the conference. So we create a conference about art here in Latin America. It is a trilingual event. So we speak Spanish, Portuguese and English. Because are the main language in Latin. America. So I have been organizing being chair of the conference since the beginning. We are in the 6th year running this and this year is going to be in Uruguay in Montevideo. We go back to in person meeting. So that is another contribution then as community manager of Aropenci, I run the Champions program. 
So we also select people from marginalized or historical group. We pair them with a mentor. We also training them how to contribute to open source, how to build packages, how to become a reviewer of software so they can be part of our OpenSci community. And I also do a lot of translations to Spanish, but not only translate material to my native. Language so more people can access. Language is a huge barrier, but I also contribute to create infrastructure to do translation. 
So for our OpenSci with the team at Mael, Elio, Paola and now Pedro from Brazil, we create a set of packages of workflow and translation guidelines to do our open site translation but for others community to use too. So I have been involved in translate books for how to teach dr. 40s book some data too so that becomes really useful material for teaching and for the groups that are in Latin America. 
You can have your event using everything in your native language in Spanish, so you don’t have to rely in English material in order to create the event or to do the workshop or to give your students if you are a university professor or someone who teach about these skills. And then if some user group, R-Ladies chapter or our UseR group, or some universities invite me to give a talk, I usually do no charge, so I try to also give back in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1544&quot;&gt;Reshama 15:44&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re involved in so many things. I sometimes wonder if you have extra hours in your days than other people do. Because I see you doing how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-1556&quot;&gt;Yanina 15:56&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will tell you my secret if you allow me two things that help me to do all these things. First, I never do this alone. I’m always lucky enough to be part of amazing teams of people. So it’s not that every single things that I say to you, I’m the only one who made this. So I’m part of team of people who do this effort, and I have the privilege to be one of the member of those teams. 
And then it’s my family. They know that I love doing this and they help me organizing the time, splitting the task at home. And even my kids, I’m working from home now, even they know my schedules. And today I was working and they were here doing school homework. My family is also a big support to be able to be present in my community when I need it with them, when I also have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1706&quot;&gt;Reshama 17:06&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. So what are three things that are so important (inaudible 17:15) over and over again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-1719&quot;&gt;Yanina 17:19&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you repeat? I lost a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1723&quot;&gt;Reshama 17:23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. What are three things that maybe the. Three priorities that keep you back to the community again and again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-1736&quot;&gt;Yanina 17:36&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three main things…..?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1740&quot;&gt;Reshama 17:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That keep you coming back to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-1743&quot;&gt;Yanina 17:43&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. Well, I think that being part of this team, like-minded people, people that have this goal to improve their reality of their community, and I mean, we have these same goals. I will summarize that we all trying to get a better wall. We want to improve the local and the global community that we live, and to know that we share some values about how we want that world to be is something that bring me coming here. Yes, I want to be part of that. I want to put my beat on improving that world. So I hope that my kids can live in a better world than the one that I have. That is something that I think we can do through community. 
The other thing is the measurable impact that you have. I mean, as a researcher, I see changes because of the work we do in 24 years. And with community, the impact is in two, three years, you can see how others people’s life change in a positive way. So you can measure those positive changes almost immediately. I mean, you can expect 20 years for a change in society on how we work. And when you see it in a more short time, it’s kind, okay, this is worth it. We can do some of the things faster. And that is good. That is cool. And the other thing is the challenge. I feel a challenge every day to do things that I never thought that I could be able to do. 
So, I mean, now I’m here speaking with you in English, feeling very comfortable because we know each other too, but you know that I have this I’m not still so confident with this second language because I learned it six, seven years ago. So I’m kind of new to do this. And I never thought that I could be doing this or could be being the community manager of an international, global community as our OpenSci that I’m so glad and so happy to do in that work that challenged me every single day. I have one mentor who teach me this idea of the three payments. 
So you have a payment that go to your pocket. The money, the one who pays the bills, the one we all need. A payment on your heart. How what you do makes you feel that makes you feel good. Do you think that is useful? That you are improving the life of others? And then the payment in the brain, how challenged this is how much you learn, how much you grow because of the tax you are doing. And I think the community give me the three payments in a very high rate, so I get that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2120&quot;&gt;Reshama 21:20&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah that’s great. I think it’s definitely worth extenuating that community work can also we learn a lot of different skills from that. And as well, there’s all these opportunities for leadership skills as well that sometimes aren’t the same opportunities that are available at the work at the current, say, employment position. But the community work can help build those skills as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-2151&quot;&gt;Yanina 21:51&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2155&quot;&gt;Reshama 21:55&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we talked a bit about all the positive, the fun aspects of community. Let’s talk a little bit about the challenges of community. So what are you observed in community or some sort of problems that are out there that are worth sort of acknowledging and discussing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-2224&quot;&gt;Yanina 22:24&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course we are talking about community are built by people. Yeah the people and the connection between them is what the community is. So as we are persons, we are going to have disagreements, we are going to have different motivations, we are going to have different goals that can become point of challenge, point of how you say, where you disagree and you need to discuss point of disagreement that happens in every single human activity. So community are not lacking that. So we are going to have these issues too.
For me one of the biggest one is that this community of practice related with technology and open source relay a lot on volunteer work and when I say volunteer work I mean people do this and don’t get paid money for doing. A lot of us found other kind of payment as I just say we find this useful, fulfilling for us in other aspects but you need to pay the bills. 
So at some points the amount of time that you can give to the community will change according how your life situation change and it’s not only that perhaps you need to work more because of the money but perhaps you become a mom as happens to me. So then you are not going to have so much time to give to the community. So I think we need to discuss and find ways to try to balance or try to find ways to have more people participating or be able to participate if they want to and to contribute and the volunteer aspect has a lot to do with that. 
I’m not saying that paying for everything is the solution because I don’t see that can be possible in the short run perhaps we need to think about that in the long run perhaps, for example in this situation that I am today, I will say don’t pay me, allow me to contribute, volunteer for example for R-Ladies, for Carpentries that I don’t get paid for volunteer day because I have another job that allow me to do that. It’s not that what I do for Carpentries, I do in our open site time. Not I do in my free time, but I have that free time because I have this chap that allow me to do this, perhaps to say, okay, allow me to do this volunteer and pay other people who can’t volunteer so we have more diverse voices. 
The other things that I see is that because of this volunteer aspect and because how the culture of the community are, we tend to burn out some of our members. So we put a lot of expectations and a lot of request over people who do this, because they love it, but they have a family, they have another job, they have other responsibilities, they have a life to take care plus this work in community. So how we take care our members don’t reach the burnout aspect that is something that we need to also discuss on how we function as a technology community. 
The other thing is the recognition of the contribution and how we value the community that have this open source aspect usually value a lot. Coding contribution and the other type of contribution are kind of second class activities and I’m not saying that it is really hard to compare but organizing a conference is a hell of work and I would like to be so valued as doing a lot of commit to a software and other kind of contribution to we need to rethink how we value and how we recognize those contributions so the people who do that get the credit that they deserve. 
The other things, all of these are related with my experience and the other thing is how we create sustainable community where the transition of power is smoothly done. That’s also sometimes hard. The founders and the leadership and the core teams and the governance and yeah, sometimes what happened is that the idea was small. And then grow up so fast that you are fighting with the pains of this fast grow and you don’t know how to handle that. 
And sometimes that burn out the people who start. And I think we should be grateful with the people who start this initiative and this community and take care of them so they don’t burn out I’m going to say this again. They don’t leave the community with a bad feeling when they create something useful and that are impacting a lot of people’s life and that happens in almost all this community that I know that happens at some point so I will really like that.
We discuss and talk and create tools to manage the human aspect of community. Not only the tech aspect of community, because you can manage that. And if we have clear rules, we learn how to do that. I’m pretty proud of the process of transition of leadership that we did at R-Ladies. It took a lot of job but I think that we achieved a smooth transition of leadership and power because that is transition of power and when you are talking about power there is always, how you say, it is a difficult thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3006&quot;&gt;Reshama 30:06&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean, transition of powers are very choppy waters because and I totally have seen this over and over where a community starts very small and in a wonderful way it grows. And in the beginning, it’s almost a little too small for a formal governance plan and it has to grow with it. And then at some point, it is difficult for the transition. So you just mentioned that you have successfully done a transition for a very large community. Are there some tips that you would give other communities on how to even maybe it’s just the top few tips or something on what made it a successful transition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-3054&quot;&gt;Yanina 30:54&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the base was that the old team has the willing of the success of the community. So we are all in the same goal. And if that success mean to do a change in the leadership because in the case of R-Ladies, because of the people who create this and found this was running this for ten years, which is a lot. So at some point they also need to take a break, a pretty well deserved break. But we all have this call of let’s do the best for the community. And the other thing is trust. We trust that we all want that and that we all will doing the best in our capacity to achieve that goal. 
So that I will say that is basic that we are all in an agreement. We want to do this change and we are all trusting in our capacity and we are doing the best for the community and then knowing that it’s going to take sometimes this takes a lot of month I think that a year for us to do the process because some of us were onboarding to learn how the leadership team run the community. So we can be sure that we have access to everything that we know, all the details that we can actually run. 
The organization and the previous leadership team, they are available to any questions that we have in case that we face some situation because it’s strange. You don’t see it in all this time that we were working together to learning how to run R-Ladies and then to be very transparent and clear with the wider community on the change and how we are doing to do this announcement altogether, the team that are stepping down and the team that are getting the new responsibility so everything is you don’t have any place to people thinking or creating theories of what is going on. 
So I think that transparency is also an important aspect of being successful on doing this and then that the team that will take over. With this time that you are seeing how things are running. You have a very clear idea the time and the complexity that this will take. So you know what you are getting into. Because be clear about that is also important because otherwise I say yes to something. And now I’m realizing that it is more big than I realized at the beginning. So with this time you also are able to know how much time and how much effort you will have to put on the community and how much help you will need also that help you to decide that. But yes, I will summarize as same goal, really having the same goal and the trust on the team that are doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3440&quot;&gt;Reshama 34:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, congratulations for successful transition. It is no small feat so it’s nice to see that it’s happened and it’s good to know that that community is well supported moving forward. Congrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-3455&quot;&gt;Yanina 34:55&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3457&quot;&gt;Reshama 34:57&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an example of when you have left a community and why you left a community and how you left the community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-3504&quot;&gt;Yanina 35:04&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have left some communities, for example minorities in our forwards, the user working group because of time essentially because even when you say that I do a lot of things, I stepped out of several others. I also stopped organizing some local conferences here in Argentina for Sadio when the association of Computer Science Professionals because I can’t do everything. So on those one I retire from this community letting them know in advance at least one month so they can also looking for someone who do the things that I used to do and I can also explain anything or give the credentials or the documents of whatever the people that will take the roles needs to do. 
And they’re mostly a nice way to live. And I appreciate the time that I spend there, the things that I learned. And I truly hope that I did something that was useful and positive for the community too. And then I have some other experience where I live with this sense of I would like to still be part, but I’m not longer being there anymore because I disagree with what is going on in the community. And that are the more painful one, that are the one who give you this sense of – I feel like drain. I think that is the word. But sometimes you vote with your feet, right? 
You don’t have other choice. And after you try to discuss and you see that the disagreement is not – you are not going to be in an agreement ever, I think for me, the decision is I fight this and perhaps damage the community or step down and allow the community to grow. And I look for another space to be able to contribute in the way that I think that we should contribute or do things in other space. And I decide to do that. 
So for some communities to say okay, I don’t feel that this space is for me anymore. I enjoy the ride for the time that lasts. I’m proud of what we did and was wonderful during this time. We create something amazing and now it’s time for me to looking for that space in other place and start to build in other place and for me that other place was our open site. Not always you need to create something new. You can also join existing community and start contributing and helping there. You don’t always need to create a new thing. You can also be part of things that already exist and align with your values, with your way of work, what you want to create in this world, so, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3902&quot;&gt;Reshama 39:02&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a good point that there are a lot of opportunities for different communities and if one doesn’t work, there’s many other that might be a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-3913&quot;&gt;Yanina 39:13&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is okay. There are cycles, there are things that start and end and I think that we all should try to rescue the positive aspect of that moment. I mean, this happens a lot as a researcher where you are changing the group of people that you work. I know that sometimes a group of people get together, do amazing things for a period of time and then for any reason, for a lot of different reason that doesn’t work anymore and you go to other group and you start create there. 
So it’s not the end of the world and sometimes it’s going to be more painful than others when you can compromise, when you can discuss that and to grow over that first disagreement, sometimes you just can. That is okay too for me – was painful in some of this experience but I like to think about the good things we create and the people that I know and the things that I learn and the people that I help. That the other aspect that made me leave the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-4042&quot;&gt;Reshama 40:42&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. Is there anything you want to share with people? Let’s face for people who sort of attend events or for them to be more involved, is there something that you wish that you had known earlier that you would want other people to know or you think that people might not know that might be helpful for them to know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanina-4104&quot;&gt;Yanina 41:04&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that try to find a community that you like the topic or the way they do things and don’t be afraid to ask, to introduce yourself and to ask how you can contribute and you don’t need to be an expert to be part of a community and to start to contribute. You don’t even need to speak well the main language of that community. Usually our communities need a lot of people who do some tasks. So there is high chance that some of your skills will. Match some need of the community. 
So I will say that if you go to some of all this community that I mentioned and you ask how you can help and you can be part, you are going to get an answer and several options on how you can start to get involved. And the path of each one of us in our communities are going to be different. And I can assure anyone that the path will be like mine. But usually you get a lot of perks to be part of this community and that benefits come from learning new things for improve your skills in different aspects, not only technical in knowing new people, knowing new organizations, and to have first-hand information on different kind of opportunities. 
And for me, it’s also a source of friendship. I have a lot of new friends that I don’t even know in person. But it has helped me a lot in not only my professional aspect, but also in my personal life. People that to speak and discuss things that concern me or to share joy that is so important as to get support when things are not going so well. 
So you also have a bunch of friends there to support you, to go to them, to ask for advice, for support, for they enjoy and be happy when you grow too. That is another things that I have in the communities so I would say that don’t be afraid of embarrassed to go to some community and try to start contributing and if that doesn’t work then go to the other, you are going to find one that suits you very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-4409&quot;&gt;Reshama 44:09&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally agree on that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-002&quot;&gt;Reshama 0:02&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do you want to introduce yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-006&quot;&gt;Mariatta 0:06&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi. Yes. My name is Mariatta. I’m an open source contributor, open source maintainer. I’m a public speaker, and I run communities. Like, I organize the Vancouver PyLadies meetups and I’ve run conferences like the PyCascades. And I am currently chairing PyCon US 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-035&quot;&gt;Reshama 0:35&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. And we met via PyLadies, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-040&quot;&gt;Mariatta 0:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, PyLadies. I mentioned PyLadies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-050&quot;&gt;Reshama 0:50&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so yeah. And tell us a little bit about what kind of work you do and what your background is in terms of work and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-102&quot;&gt;Mariatta 1:02&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so I studied computer science a long time ago, so I am, like, developer by training. In the past 15 years, I’ve worked in companies like startups and corporations. I’ve worked at Zapier, I’ve worked at Google most recently, and in the past, I also work at Sony Pictures Imageworks. So if you watch some movies like the Angry Birds movie, or I think one of the Spiderman movie, I don’t remember if you watch all the way till the end where the credits roll all the way till the end, and you’ll probably find my name in those movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-147&quot;&gt;Reshama 1:47&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohh, I didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-150&quot;&gt;Mariatta 1:50&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I don’t remember which Spiderman, but the first Angry Birds movie for sure. I’ve been working for a long time in the tech industry in the past few years. Actually, it’s been ten years, more than ten years since I started doing Python development, doing web based development. And then I started contributing to Python and open source community, starting to be involved with the PyLadies as well. 
And for those who don’t know, python is, like, one of the most popular programming languages out there. So it’s an open source project. And about PyLadies itself, PyLadies is a global community that’s focused on providing mentorship. We aim to help more women into becoming active participants and leaders in the Python community so that we are not just users of Python, but we are taking active participation. That’s the goal and mission of the PyLadies community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-306&quot;&gt;Reshama 3:06&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, and so you shared the communities that you’re a member and a contributor of…. How did you first get involved in the Python community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-320&quot;&gt;Mariatta 3:20&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for me, for the longest time, I just used Python. Like, I developed Python code. I didn’t know anything about the community. There was no sense of community where I was using Python. Like, the people who I know who use Python are my coworkers in my company. But around 2015, I have heard about the PyLadies community, and I actually received financial aid from PyLadies that allowed me to attend PyCon conference. For the first time, I get to attend PyCon through the PyLadies financial aid in Montreal, and it’s from that conference, PyCon, that I really get to learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get to see other people, lots of people who use Python, more community members, and I get to learn about issues within the community, the Python community. And I just became interested in wanting to participate and see what I can do. It was at that conference PyCon US when I heard Guido Van Rosen’s keynote speech. And he talked about at that time, there was no women at all as the maintainer, as the core developers of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at that time, all the core developers of Python, like 20 years long, everybody has been men. So that’s an issue that I feel like related. That’s an issue that we see in the tech industries. But at that time, I didn’t actually feel even like even though I use Python, I didn’t feel like I’m part of the community. 
I heard there’s this problem, I didn’t do anything, right? I didn’t feel like it’s something I should participate in or contribute to. Basically, I excluded myself for reasons I don’t know, but I continued participating. I really get to learn more about Python and the community. So the year after that, I returned again to the conference. Again, I received financial aid from PyLadies that allowed me to go. And again at that one year later, Guido came back to give a keynote, and still he said there was still no women in the core developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I felt, well, okay, maybe this time I will participate and see what I can do here. I became determined. I braced myself. Like, I wrote an email to friend Guido Van Rossum, who was total stranger to me at the time, and I actually felt lucky that he replied and just helped me really get into the core Python community. And it just keeps going on from there. Like, I just started contributing to Python more into the community, and it keeps going until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-714&quot;&gt;Reshama 7:14&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s amazing. That’s wonderful. And you are the first woman core developer for the Python language, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-720&quot;&gt;Mariatta 7:20&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, actually, I think about less than a year since I first emailed Guido, they decided they will have me as one of the core developers. And I was the first. And I think we have a few women now. Carol Willing is also a co-developer. We have Emily Morehouse, Lisa Roach, Irit Katriel, Cheryl Sabella. Joanna. We have Joanna Nanjekye. Probably mispronounce her name. I think that’s all like, we have few women compared to I think we have work to do there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-818&quot;&gt;Reshama 8:18&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice. It’s definitely room for improvement, but it’s also very impressive. So it’s good to see the progress that’s been made. What does community mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-834&quot;&gt;Mariatta 8:34&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I didn’t know this. As I mentioned, for the longest time, I did not have a community. But to me, the community is where I have a sense of belonging. I feel like I am a part of this, that I feel accepted without needing to prove myself. And for me, it’s important being an immigrant by default. 
When I first came to Canada, I felt by default, I’m an outsider, that there are things I know as an outsider, there are certain rights that I don’t certain rights or privileges that I don’t have. Whereas in a community I feel like I am one of them. I feel it’s the group where we all have a sense of belonging and that we also share the same passion, the same goal. We have a vision of what this community is about, and we are all wanting to accomplish that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-957&quot;&gt;Reshama 9:57&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think that your thoughts about community, how has it changed since the pandemic, if anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-1004&quot;&gt;Mariatta 10:04&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything?…Since the pandemic, it made me realize or it made me feel happy or glad that I have found this community, the Python community before the pandemic, that having connection, having connected with the Python community in person at conferences or online, through social channels helped me get through it because just last week I was talking to a friend. I think she felt burned out from the pandemic because she hasn’t been going to work, she hasn’t met a lot of new people. 
She felt stuck. Whereas for me, I feel like, well, thanks to the community, I continue to do the things I enjoy. I was still able to meet new friends online, I still attend Python conferences, even virtually, and it helps me with my own personal mental health. So that’s what I felt about community. Like, I’m glad I found you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-1140&quot;&gt;Mariatta 11:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad we met through the community as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1143&quot;&gt;Reshama 11:43&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And why do you contribute to the community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-1150&quot;&gt;Mariatta 11:50&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I really have gained a lot. Like the community really has given me a lot of new opportunities, new learning opportunities, the opportunities to show my skills, my leadership skills. Sometimes at work you were given certain tasks and you can’t always do the things you enjoy, or maybe the opportunities just weren’t open to you. Whereas I feel within the community, I get to do that. They allow me to do things. Participating in the community, like giving talks, lets me run PyCon US. It’s such a privilege. 
And I really learned a lot. I really learned more about Python itself, like technical skills. I think when I started contributing to open source, I didn’t know a lot about how to package Python library. Like, I’ve never published anything to PyPi, for example, by getting involved in the Python community, now I know how to publish stuff to PyPI. Just an example. I know more about Git, for example. I didn’t have to know a lot about those at my work at the time. 
So I really learn a lot. So I feel like the only way for me to give back, to say thanks for the committee, for giving me all of that, is just continue contributing, like paid forward, letting by sharing my experiences, sharing what I’ve learned to other people, hoping that other people will see that they can gain from the community too. I would just want to pay it forward and hoping more people can benefit from the community just like I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1415&quot;&gt;Reshama 14:15&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes you want to keep coming back and contributing to the community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-1423&quot;&gt;Mariatta 14:23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I really learned a lot from the community and I enjoyed the experience. I get to travel and speak at conferences from all over the world. The Committee has helped me grow, gained new skills and at work a lot of times the things I do are private and copyrighted. Not the things I can talk publicly about, but the things I see in the Python communities. Those are things I can talk more openly about. And it is the community that gives me materials and ideas and inspirations for me to give new talks, new tutorials. So the more I participate, the more I contribute, the more I learn, the more opportunities for me to give talks and give tutorials. 
And these are actually things I like doing. I really enjoy speaking. That’s something I want to do more. The other reason that I continue to contribute in the Python community is that the same issue that brought me in, in the first place. Like I saw there is problem with diversity and inclusion in the Python community. I think that issue still exists now. Like as I mentioned, we have gotten better. We have more women in the core team now, but I think we’re still a minority. I feel like there are still barriers that we face. I don’t actually know what to do, but I’m hoping by staying here, I can still do something to help. I really think our work to improve diversity in the Python communities is still not done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1640&quot;&gt;Reshama 16:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for that. Can you give an example when an interaction with a community or an event has gone like really, really well, like an experience that you want to share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-1657&quot;&gt;Mariatta 16:57&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, one experience that I feel really proud about is the PyCascades community. PyCascades is a Python conference that we started myself and a few others from the people in the Pacific Northwest area. So the area of BC (British Columbia), Canada, Washington and Oregon, US. What I feel makes it successful is when we founded this community, when we said we want to have the PyCascades community, the organizers, the leaders, we have a clear vision, like we among ourselves, like what we want this conference to look like. Not only that, we want to grow the Python community in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific Northwest, we really focus a lot on being inclusive and that we care. We’re going to care a lot about the diversity of the community, the attendees and the speakers. It’s something we were very intentional about. It wasn’t just hey, let’s put another regional Python conference, but we have a vision and specific characteristics of what we want this community to be. And the whole organizing team, the leaders, we share the same common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So everything, every decisions we made, it was all about fulfilling this vision, this goal. And we know that. I could see from my co organizers, everyone was really committed to our goal. So I feel that when there is this shared goal, shared purpose and commitment from all the members. I feel the community has the community was successful. It is successful. And just as important is the leaders themselves who are able to execute those vision and coordinate the efforts with the different community members. I think this is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-1942&quot;&gt;Reshama 19:42&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still involved in organizing it? And if yes or no, how do you keep the conference and the community going whether you’re still involved or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-1957&quot;&gt;Mariatta 19:57&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with PyCascades, I am not very involved in it anymore. After the first three years, I felt like I needed to step down from it. I needed to step down for reasons, but I felt that, you know, after three years of being involved in PyCascades, I really have learned a lot. It opened up lots of opportunities for me, but I realized that I have other priorities. 
So I stepped down and I felt guilty at first, but in the end I figured that maybe by stepping down, by leaving this space open, somebody else could fill in and somebody else would be able to learn, like, have the same experience I have and grow themselves. And I feel that vision, that goals that we have is also shared by the new organizers.  And I think that’s one of the reason I felt okay with stepping down. Like, I know the new generation of leaders will also continue what we want to accomplish with the community. So I think that’s what helped, having that goal written down somewhere and that it is communicated like what PyCascades is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2148&quot;&gt;Reshama 21:48&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you think about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2150&quot;&gt;Mariatta 21:50&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, I think I didn’t answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2154&quot;&gt;Reshama 21:54&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. I was going to ask you, what do you think with the pandemic? There’s a number of regional conferences that have gone dormant. And what do you think it is about Podcast Kids? Because I think they’ve continued to have their annual conference. Right? What do you think about it, let that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2210&quot;&gt;Mariatta 22:10&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s really there are community members who also care about it and willing to spend their time and energy because they care so much about this community. They want to see it continuing and that’s how we are able to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2240&quot;&gt;Reshama 22:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you still speak at PyCascades even if you’re not involved in organizing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2248&quot;&gt;Mariatta 22:48&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not spoken at PyCascades yet, but hopefully next year I will try to submit something. Yes, I did attend this year. It was in Vancouver. I even get to attend with my whole family. I brought like, my husband, my two children came to PyCascades. It was really fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2303&quot;&gt;Reshama 23:03&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very nice. Very nice. So I guess on the other side of it, through the many years that you’ve been involved in community work, there’s also challenges that we experience as well. And so can you sort of share an example or an experience when things have not gone well? And how you’ve sort of addressed it, dealt with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2338&quot;&gt;Mariatta 23:38&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the opposite of success is really that’s where it doesn’t work. When there is no governance or no nuclear leadership. Sometimes when you say everybody is equal, everybody does the same thing. It ended up being nobody is doing it, nobody is making decisions. I think having a governance model, having a leader like leadership, either one person or a group of people that will be important. So when there is no government, no governance, no leaders, that’s when nothing gets done in the community. Another example is that when decisions that were made by maybe people who thinks or who wants to make decisions, their decision weren’t respected by other members. 
I’ve seen examples where I think even an example where after Guido Van Rossum accepted PEP 572, somehow he received lots of negative reaction from the Python community members about acceptance of that PEP 572 is the assignment expressions which we all know now as the Walrus operator that led him into retiring as the BDFL. I think that’s one example where communities didn’t seem to respect a decision made by the leader. So it happened in the Python community. It caused people to leave, to burn out. 
And I’ve seen also in this kind of situation where there is disagreement or conflict, sometimes it’s the bad actor. Like the person who caused conflict are the people who would still stick around. And the people who were hurt, they ended up leaving. Like people who maybe could have more positive contribution to the community. They ended up leaving because we let that actress to stick around. So I think those are some examples where I’ve seen things are going well in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2644&quot;&gt;Reshama 26:44&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think some other sort of challenges that I faced in community is retaining community members. In terms of there is the issue of burnout. There’s a lot more work that needs to be done than there are people available for it. And also in terms of volunteers, whatever, having people there’s a lot of people that initially start working with the community on an event or something, and then a lot of them fall through and there’s a smaller group that’s left. Do you have any thoughts about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2725&quot;&gt;Mariatta 27:25&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I can relate to that. And I feel sometimes there are people who want to sign up, say, I want to help out. But I think a lot of work that community organizers do, some of them are in the background, are not visible, that we – I don’t know. I feel some of those work are important and maybe less appealing to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2807&quot;&gt;Reshama 28:07&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think sometimes people don’t know when they get involved that there’s a lot of administrative work, it’s not technical work and maybe people get involved in the community expect a different kind of experience than it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2827&quot;&gt;Mariatta 28:27&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and I think… I feel like… I think that’s probably something we can do better by documenting the process of what’s involved. But even so, I don’t know, I feel like, for example, in the open source community, I feel like people want to contribute to certain things. Like they want to write code, they want to make pull requests, whereas there are other things, like you said, there are administrative work, there are triaging or other issues like documentation. Those don’t receive the same enthusiasm as certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-2917&quot;&gt;Reshama 29:17&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think that’s partly also a matter of maybe, like it’s also not viewed by some people in the team as a more valuable contribution than, say, administrative work versus tech quote contributions versus non code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-2937&quot;&gt;Mariatta 29:37&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve definitely heard those. I don’t know for me, and I think maybe that’s just how it is. But for me, I really respect people who do everything else in the background and I really know a lot of people because I’m involved in the community. There are a lot more work in managing community management, community coordination that there is no…I don’t know. You don’t see they do it until the only proof that they do things is that there is this wonderful event where everybody is happy. You don’t see it until after you go to the conference, to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3030&quot;&gt;Reshama 30:30&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-3033&quot;&gt;Mariatta 30:33&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those takes months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3037&quot;&gt;Reshama 30:37&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of invisible work that makes open source projects happen, events happen, resources being created. It’s not so apparent. But I think… (Crosstalk) It’s good for letting people know that there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-3059&quot;&gt;Mariatta 30:59&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I feel maybe that’s as a community, something we how do we highlight those kind of work more? Right? Yeah. I don’t know. That’s something to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3114&quot;&gt;Reshama 31:14&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you have any advice or anything you want to share with people who say, let’s say people who have not are sort of looking at communities and maybe they attend an event here and there, like, say, a meet up? What would you say to someone who has not sort of been involved in community? In terms of as a contributor? Definitely as a participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I think as a participant, it’s important too, like someone who attends because it takes a while for people to get the confidence to attend an event. That’s a big step. Sort of getting especially now post pandemic, getting people out the door to meet people and then also being someone who sort of contributes to the community. What advice would you have for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-3205&quot;&gt;Mariatta 32:05&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, for the participants, this is from my own experience, as I too as I mentioned, my first ever PyCon, I did not make a lot of new friends. I attended a lot of speakers. I didn’t even feel like I’m part of the community. I didn’t dare coming to the speakers just to say thank you for the great talk. And now I feel like I wish I have done that, you know. But even if you are new, even if you are a user of Python, you are part of the community. Even as the user, you can participate. And really, it doesn’t take a lot for you to start participating. 
You don’t have to be a famous person in order to start participating. Even if you are just starting, you have something to contribute. Really reach out to the maybe local community organizers, local meetups and ask how you can help. But don’t just ask how you can help. Also explain to them or tell them like, hey, I’m good at certain things. These are my time availability, I can do X, Y and Z. Just let me help you. And that would be more helpful to the community organizers because just show your commitment to it. Show what you can do. Because as community organizers, sometimes, like you mentioned, we get lots of people wanting to help. 
We don’t know what they want to help with. They might have different interests, right? By communicating that ahead, I think that would make it easier for them. And also, how do I say this? Be persistent in offering your help. Maybe you think that I’m offering it once they will reach out to me. Sometimes they just really got busy, I think. Don’t hesitate to just reach out again and saying, I’m still interested to help. I can do certain things so that will make them trust you more, knowing that you are committed to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3448&quot;&gt;Reshama 34:48&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other suggestions or recommendations that you want to share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-3456&quot;&gt;Mariatta 34:56&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some suggestions for like, once you’re part or once you become more active in your community members, and especially if you are running or managing community, I really suggest that I think it should be a requirement that you write things down, have documentation, like, of what your community is about, like the process, especially having what is your community’s goal and vision and mission. Sometimes if you’ve been doing it forever, you just end up just going through the motion and you forgot the real goal of your community. 
I think sometimes you need to remind yourself and the community of what this is all about. Because sometimes the community grow, right? Maybe there are new members with different ideas joined, and maybe you need to refocus or reiterate what your community is about. The other thing that I think is important is as community leaders, you have to enable your members, train them into becoming leaders because I feel like I think it’s true in many open source projects, even maybe it was started by one or two people and they ended up doing or owning everything. Like everything has to go through them. Not only like merging pull requests, but also replying to questions, replying to emails, deploying to somewhere. I feel like those are tasks that eventually you should be able to delegate or have more people helping you. Maybe in the beginning it’s okay that you do it yourself with one other person, but your committee will grow. Such effort will not scale. I think at some point after you have a community, one of your goal is not just having more members, but how are you growing your members?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you elevate them from users, members into leaders within your community? I feel like you need to start thinking about mentoring people, give them more responsibilities as you see them become active, give them more responsibilities and turn them into leaders. And not just to give them more tasks, but I think it’s a way to show your appreciation for their contributions by promoting them or giving them more power within the community and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3812&quot;&gt;Reshama 38:12&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting them as well. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-3814&quot;&gt;Mariatta 38:14&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. And trusting them with your project, something you started. And I think being trusted by other people for me, even when they trust me with Bike on US, that’s a big honor. I feel like it’s actually a good thing and I’m grateful for that. I think that’s a good way to show to thank your contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-3840&quot;&gt;Reshama 38:40&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for PyCon us, how did your role as chairperson of the conference come about? Was there a call? Did you volunteer? What were your next stage in terms of responsibilities? How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-3900&quot;&gt;Mariatta 39:00&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did it happen? I don’t know. I think it was because I was already involved in other like I have already chaired chair by Cascades and being involved in the Python committee when they were looking for the next conference chairs, maybe they just thought of me as a candidate. So actually it was E who was chairing PyCon us in Cleveland back in, I don’t remember, 2018, 2019 at the time, he approached me and asked if I’d be interested in the role. And I thought, I guess at the time I was a bit busy and occupied with PyCascades and other things. I wasn’t ready for that. And I said, not right now, but maybe check again in a few years. So I guess the next conference chair, I’m Emily Morehouse, she became the conference after E, and then she became the conference chair. And then I guess after that, when they were looking for somebody to take over, they think about me again. So at that time I thought, yeah, I have the capacity, I think I can do this. That’s how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-4036&quot;&gt;Reshama 40:36&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s worth sharing for people because I remember when I started off, in the beginning, I didn’t know how to be involved. And I think it’s important to share that if there’s a specific sort of regional or local or a certain topical conference that you’re interested in, reach out to the conference and let them know of your interest. And you can be involved in that way. A lot of times it is through being involved at the bottom and you go up and you work your way up in terms of experience. 
And sometimes it’s through network where somebody knows you. But even when someone isn’t connected via network, they can reach out as well and get connected to the network by that without knowing people. And I think I didn’t know that and I don’t know if other people know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-4121&quot;&gt;Mariatta 41:21&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think that’s definitely important that you don’t have to wait to be asked. And I guess I think for me right now, I’m in the position where people ask me for lots of things because they’ve seen me do all of this. But indeed, in the beginning it was just you got to show up. Even with the Python, like, contributing to Python, you don’t have to be invited to start contributing. You just have to show up and just start watch our mailing list or something or our GitHub issues. Start creating pull requests. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start showing up to your local communities and talk to the meetup organizers or local conference organizers. For example, the PyLadies is organizing a conference, and we put out a call for volunteers from all the Python community events that I’ve seen. We always meet volunteers. So that’s one of the way you can help out, really reach out to the organizer and say, I want help, I have certain ideas. I want to do this or that. I think this just start sharing your idea, saying, I think this will be beneficial to the committee. Can I do this? How do you want me to help you? Right? You don’t have to be asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-4305&quot;&gt;Reshama 43:05&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s good. And so we’ve talked about how to become involved in a specific community that someone might be interested in. Let’s talk about the other side of it, which is leaving or exiting a community. So what are your thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-4323&quot;&gt;Mariatta 43:23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I feel it’s okay to leave. As I mentioned, I left PyCascades. Like, I’ve built a community, and at some point I thought I’m meant to be with this committee forever. But at some point I found I guess I was burned out. Like, a lot of things was happening to me. At the same time, I realized I was burned out. And I thought it would be good to leave. And really, it turns out good. Like, I really felt by leaving, by opening up the space for somebody else, I really feel the committee can have new ideas and they are really doing great. I was really impressed. Like, I had a great time at the last PyCascades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think I also heard a lot from people who initially said, it’s okay, I can do this. I have lots of free time. I don’t mind doing this thing forever. And I’ve seen again and again the same people ended up burned out and could no longer continue. So I really think it’s really okay to step down to leave. Even if the community that you build yourself, I think if you already have that goal that you have shared with the community, you have documentation, you have trained community members into becoming leaders, you will be able to leave, maybe take a break. You don’t have to think about, I’m leaving forever. You could take a break and leave. Leave it to your co organizers. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-4558&quot;&gt;Reshama 45:58&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are many, you know, there’s so many options out there. There’s so many opportunities to get involved in different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mariatta-4609&quot;&gt;Mariatta 46:09&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I think that’s also one of the things I realized myself, like I have with PyCascades. I have been involved from the beginning. I felt like I know everything or I have done the same thing for three years. It’s time for me to learn something else and maybe meet new community members. Right? So by leaving, it opens myself up for other opportunities, new skills. It allows me to take on the role as PyCon US Chair. I think that end up to be to be a good thing for me. At least don’t think of leaving or quitting as the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama-4703&quot;&gt;Reshama 47:03&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s great. And with that, that’s a great way to end it. And with that, I am just going to stop the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Let&apos;s Talk Community with Beryl Kanali</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;a href=&quot;https://reshamas.github.io&quot;&gt;Reshama Shaikh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We speak with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/berylkanali/&quot;&gt;Beryl Kanali&lt;/a&gt; about her experience in communities since she first became involved in 2021 after participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dataumbrella.org/data-umbrella-afme2-2021-scikit-learn-sprint-report&quot;&gt;scikit-learn sprint, October 2021&lt;/a&gt; organized by Data Umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-beryl-kanali&quot;&gt;About Beryl Kanali&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beryl Kanali is a Data Scientist, Community Manager and Open Source Enthusiast. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and is currently in her final year of a master’s degree in Statistics. She is a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataumbrella.org/&quot;&gt;Data Umbrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc&quot;&gt;PyMC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreachy.org/&quot;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioconductor.org/&quot;&gt;Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0000&quot;&gt;Reshama  00:00&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, great. Okay. You know, can you introduce yourself to, you know, tell us a bit about yourself what you currently do in the data space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0009&quot;&gt;Beryl  00:09&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Beryl Kanali, I am a data scientist and community manager. I’m currently a master’s student pursuing a master’s in statistics. And apart from that, I volunteer as a Data Umbrella Community Manager, part time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0028&quot;&gt;Reshama  00:28&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What communities are you a member and a contributor of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0032&quot;&gt;Beryl  00:32&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently, I am a member and contributor of one the umbrella community, the Outreachy community, the Bioconductor community and the PyMC community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0047&quot;&gt;Reshama  00:47&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how did you first become involved in these communities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0052&quot;&gt;Beryl  00:52&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So typically, my community involvement started in 2021, where I joined the Data Umbrella scikit-learn sprint, and then from there is when I learnt about communities, and then I joined that Data Umbrella community, where I  later came on as a community manager. For the Bioconductor community and Outreachy community, I applied for the Outreachy internship, which is an internship that happens twice a year. So I was in the 2022 December cohort, where I was working under the Bioconductor project for documenting Sweave to RMD documents to RMarkdown documents. And for the PyMC community, I also got involved through the Data Umbrella community, I am a contributor, and I was a manager there. So that is how I got involved with the PyMC community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0148&quot;&gt;Reshama  01:48&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. What does community mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0154&quot;&gt;Beryl  01:54&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I would say community means being in the same space as people who have the same interests and goals as you. And it’s a place where you can interact and exchange knowledge with people. And you can also be of service to other community members by teaching and mentoring others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0218&quot;&gt;Reshama  02:18&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think makes community so important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0223&quot;&gt;Beryl  02:23&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience, I think what makes community so important is the ability to work together and learn from others. So individually, especially in the tech space, there’s a little much of information out there. So it can be confusing on what to take in and what not to take in so coming in a community, you have people who are around you that have gone through the same journey, and you can learn from them. It’s also a way of getting impact to other people. If you volunteer for our community, or as a part of a community, you can be involved in activities that might be of impact in terms of growing other people and also growing, very encouraging coming up projects that might be of interest to other people who have the same interest as us. That is why I think community is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0319&quot;&gt;Reshama  03:19&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why do you contribute to these communities that you are a part of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0323&quot;&gt;Beryl  03:23&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my main motivation towards contributing to communities is it’s our way of learning, I think the best way of learning is by doing so being part of these communities and me contributing to these communities, in different capacities, it’s enabled me to learn when, as a data professional and two, as a community manager as well. And generally just as a person, there are also other non technical skills that you get to learn from the community. So that’s the main contribution the main reason I contribute to community, it’s also a way of giving back to the community, I have been a beneficiary of communities where I’ve learned a lot through communities. So as my way of giving back to this community, is being able to continue to the projects they have or the initiatives. And also it’s part of me doing something that is greater not only for myself, but for out there who might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0419&quot;&gt;Reshama  04:19&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a great answer. What makes you keep coming back and contributing to the communities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0429&quot;&gt;Beryl  04:29&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I would say is the communities that I’m in a very welcoming in that you really feel welcomed and a part of the people there. So that is the main reasons why I keep coming back because I know like the people in those communities are free to like answer my questions, help me find my way in case I need some clarification on things and also helped me grow. And the other thing is, the skills that I learned most of my skills have learned through community. So it helps me keep in touch with what’s going on, what skills I need to learn and keep coming back and contribution to this community as a way to learn and grow my skills and also use the skills that I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0514&quot;&gt;Reshama  05:14&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’re involved in a, you know, a few different communities but let’s go to say the Data Umbrella community, how have you found the Data Umbrella community work to be beneficial to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0527&quot;&gt;Beryl  05:27&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one is a sense of belonging. So as Data Umbrella is a community of underrepresented people in data science, machine learning and AI, I have had that sense of belonging where I have met people who were even never part of community such as the Data Umbrella before. So the first benefit from that Data Umbrella is just having that sense of belonging that there is a community I can learn from and can contribute to that less of any other factor that might be surrounding me. They are other thing about Data Umbrella is I have learned a lot in 2021 November till now it’s not that much of time, but I have learnt a lot in terms of technical skills and non technical skills. So through the events that Data Umbrella holds I have gotten to learn some technical stuff that I didn’t know or only learned in a classroom setting or on my own. I’ve also learned some non technical skills, which are very important in terms of interacting with people and growing my career, and also opportunities. Data Umbrella has really opened a lot of opportunities for me, I have learned on what I can do as a person, not only as a data scientist, but my community management journey started at Data Umbrella, which has now grown where I have been able to work as a community manager, and I look forward to working as a community manager and just having Data Umbrella as part of my resume, it has really opened a lot of opportunities and networks with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0657&quot;&gt;Reshama  06:57&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I guess some of those opportunities are your involvements and other communities such as Outreachy. And with Bioconductor, as well as PyMC, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0710&quot;&gt;Beryl  07:10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0711&quot;&gt;Reshama  07:11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you’re also actually you’re also involved in a mentoring community, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0717&quot;&gt;Beryl  07:17&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, I am part of KamiLimu, which is a nonprofit mentoring program where we mentor upcoming university students who want to have careers in tech. So the main goal of KamiLimu is to complement the classroom skills that these students have with the outside skills that might not be taught in a classroom setting. So for example, CV writing, presentation skills, research skills, how to pitch in an innovation competition, how to present your ideas, public speaking, and whatnot. So we just tried to complement what the students don’t learn in a formal classroom setting, with skills that I needed outside there for them to thrive in the different tech careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0810&quot;&gt;Reshama  08:10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you name an example? About an instance when you’ve seen a community event work really, really well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0816&quot;&gt;Beryl  08:16&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ll give an example of Outreachy. So Outreachy, being a community, especially in the open source space, I have seen people joining the community as just community members, and then being able to get internships in different projects, and those internships have turned to those interns getting full time jobs. I have also seen people meeting others from different countries under Outreachy communities, because it caters to people from different continents. So I’ve also seen people networking, and people starting initiatives, after being part of the Outreachy community. I have also seen people starting startups. So for example, in the Kamilimu community that are a part of and also a mentor, I have seen people start by just learning how to innovate, which went and now we have like, full startups. Like for example, here in Kenya, we have different startups that have been born and nurtured through KamiLimu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--0929&quot;&gt;Reshama  09:29&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, you know, can you name an instance when you think, you know, where you’ve seen community not work well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--0937&quot;&gt;Beryl  09:37&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’ve been thought of other communities apart from the ones that I’ve mentioned before. And sadly, I didn’t get a reason to go back to those communities because I felt that the communities did not work. So one of the reasons was, well, we had the leadership of the community treat the community as a personal entity. So when people in a community run a community, even if it’s volunteer, but they want it for commercial gain, and they do not take care of the community members needs and what the community members might benefit from. Then that is one step to failing as a community. So for me I have been part of communities where I joined the communities, but it didn’t work. And the main reason was like, the leadership of the community, it didn’t really take into consideration what the real meaning of our community is, but instead took it as a private company and wanted to take ownership, which really been a lot of people drop out of those communities, or did not really get what they wanted from that those communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--1047&quot;&gt;Reshama  10:47&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you know, you’ve been a Community Contributor for a while, at least 2021? Or before that, would you say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--1056&quot;&gt;Beryl  10:56&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, somehow, let’s just say 2021 is when I was active, very active in contributing, especially, not just being part of the communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--1105&quot;&gt;Reshama  11:05&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you? What are you like, what are some of the challenges of being a community contributor? You know, what, like, what difficult situations have you faced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--1117&quot;&gt;Beryl  11:17&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one is like language barrier. And let’s just talk about demographics in general. So when you’re part of communities, especially after the inception of COVID, most communities had to go the online route. So when you have a community that has people from different demographics, there’s always an issue of one language barrier and two time. Time is a really big factor, when you have people are having a time difference of 10 + hours, and maybe you want to have an event for the community. So sometimes, it poses difficulty in just making sure that we can include as much people as possible in those activities. And number two is language barriers. Most communities especially that I’m part of operate in English but I have been part of other communities where we had a lot of people, that their primary language was not English. And given that communities, mostly are run by volunteers. So just being able to have resources that accommodate people who do not understand or speak English has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty is our community is made up of people and people really have different personalities. And I’ve worked in communities where you had to really learn how to accommodate people’s personalities, sometimes it has worked, but sometimes it has not, where some people have felt like, they’re not appreciated, or they’re not heard. So dealing with people’s personalities, sometimes might pose as a challenge, being a member of a community and also being  a volunteer of a community. And the other thing is, community requires a lot of self motivation. If you’re a contributor to the community, it requires a lot of self motivation, because you’re not being paid to contribute to your community most of the time, or you’re not being compensated. So it’s something that comes from the heart. And the difficulty of first is that some people might think that community contributors have all the time, and that they’re doing this, because they are paid or something like that. So it has been a difficult situation in terms where you have to explain to some community members, to be patient to volunteers or other committee members in terms of time to attempt to get their needs or answer their questions. But all in all, given that committees are like a group of people with the same interest, sometimes these are difficulties that will come and go and also come in future. So it’s just a way of learning as a community member and as a community contributor, how can I navigate these difficulties when they come. And also how can we like make committee members read from the same page in terms of how they can accommodate each other and provide a welcoming environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--1426&quot;&gt;Reshama  14:26&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, one of the things that I’ve noticed from collaborating with you, as well as is the is the internet access issue as well. And that different tools work in you know, better in different regions, for example, you know, we used to use, you know, say discord, for online events or zoom. But, you know, in certain regions, for instance, Google Meet works better because it’s much lighter in terms of, you know, technical resources to work and so, that’s important as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--1459&quot;&gt;Beryl  14:59&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s also, important, especially speaking from my experience of coming from Africa, you might find some community members really want to be part of communities. But as a community you can’t provide data bundles, which, especially in my continent, it’s very expensive. And sometimes the best internet bandwidth we have, cannot support some of the tools that are out here. So communities are going to really have to like adapt. Like in Data Umbrella we have to like use tools that are like can be used by as many people as possible, especially the lightweight tools like Google Meet. Sometimes Zoom also is a good tool, but it requires a higher bandwidth as compared to Google Meet, the same to discord. So yeah, those are some of the difficulties. And with time, it keeps getting better as other countries develop. But this is also something that really troubles a lot of other communities, not just Data Umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--1602&quot;&gt;Reshama  16:02&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you think, you know, we’ve had this discussion a few times, how do you think we can sort of, you know, it hasn’t been easy to sort of attract and retain volunteers, right? Do you have any ideas on how you how to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--1621&quot;&gt;Beryl  16:21&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, I would say one is definitely given that communities are run by volunteers. And this is, as I said, free work that mostly requires a lot of self motivation. I think, one communities have to understand that it’s a gradual process. One, you have to work with what you have, right now and first. And the other thing is to identify what will make a volunteer like what type of volunteers we have, because like in  Data Umbrella, we had to like sit down and think of how can people contribute as volunteers, different ways to contribute given that, as volunteers, we can’t all contribute in the same aspect. So one it would be to identify the different ways a volunteer can contribute to your community. And then when you call out for volunteers, and they come, it’s good to explain to them the different ways they can contribute to the communities, what is needed from them. Because I have seen cases where people want to volunteer, yes, they want to volunteer but they do not know what is required of them, and what time they might need, their availability and how much self motivation they might need. So many of them, it’s like they don’t really have a good understanding of what they’re signing up for. So making sure that those people who want to contribute to your community understand what they’re getting themselves into, would be a good way. Another thing is, would be, sometimes give it time, most people who become community volunteers, are people who have been part of the community for long [time], not in all cases. But I think as community members sometimes change, like for us in Data Umbrella, we might have like consistent community members and contributors. And some of them are not like consistent. So giving it time and making sure that at the end of the day, it will be like something someone is willing to do. And sometimes it’s just asking sometimes you’d never know if someone wants to become a contributor or a volunteer, if you do not ask, so asking, like advertising there, hey would like volunteers, but at the same time being open minded that this volunteer might come and it will be a long term thing, it might be just a short term thing, a short term thing, and be okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--1851&quot;&gt;Reshama  18:51&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, thanks. Is there anything else that you want to share that you know, you want you want to share with people in the community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--1859&quot;&gt;Beryl  18:59&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think my advice in short will just be like it we should all being part of communities, we should all try and create healthy communities, which is really important, like a community where your community members feel welcome included. Always taking feedback from community members, sometimes there’s no feedback, but just asking them, Hey, can you give us feedback, sometimes it helps to know what your community members are thinking. So all in all, communities are evolving. The world is becoming smaller. So we have a lot of people from different backgrounds, different cultures. So just making sure that we are fostering healthy communities, and making sure that our community members are feeling like they are welcome and included in the community will go a long way as we strive to build better communities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshama--1951&quot;&gt;Reshama  19:51&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beryl--1953&quot;&gt;Beryl  19:53&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gitpod&quot;&gt;Gitpod&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ben Meares of the PyMC Team set up a Gitpod container for the pymc repository.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sangam SwadiK tested the Gitpod container.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reshama Shaikh wrote up instructions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/contributing/using_gitpod.html&quot;&gt;Using Gitpot to Contribute to PyMC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reshama Shaikh created a video on How to Contribute to PyMC Using Gitpod.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;website-translations&quot;&gt;Website Translations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oriol Abril Pla and Sandra Yojana Meneses worked together to set up the event website so it could be translated using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://explore.transifex.com/pymc/data-umbrella-sprints-website/&quot;&gt;platform Transifex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reshama Shaikh wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest/contributing/language-translations.html&quot;&gt;Language Instructions&lt;/a&gt; so contributors could submit translations using Transifex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;website-translators&quot;&gt;Website Translators&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank all the community members who contributed to translating the website to Spanish or Portuguese:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sandra Yojana Meneses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cristina Mulas Lopez&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ariel Silvio Norberto Ramos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alberto Mario Ceballos-Arroyo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jose Rafael Camejo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Juliana Almeida&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cristián Maureira-Fredes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anavelyz Perez&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Barbara Graniello Batlle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cristina Zenteno&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leonardo Gomez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pair-programming&quot;&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants worked in pairs.  We paired experienced contributors with new contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;event-info&quot;&gt;Event Info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No participants joined from Latin America, though ~10 people from Latin American did register for the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We expect that the website translations, particularly in Spanish, will be beneficial for the community, even after this event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next-maintaining-the-momentum&quot;&gt;What’s Next: Maintaining the Momentum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen a few event participants continue to contribute after the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to maintain the momentum by holding casual monthly “study groups” on Discord to continue contributing to PyMC.&lt;/p&gt;
