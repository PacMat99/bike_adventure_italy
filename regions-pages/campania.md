Campania boasts some of Italy's most fascinating and culturally rich cities. Naples, its capital, is a lively and chaotic metropolis famous for its artistic and architectural heritage, delicious cuisine, and contagious energy.

The Cilento area, with its pristine beaches and hilly landscapes covered with olive groves and vineyards, is an oasis of tranquility and beauty.
