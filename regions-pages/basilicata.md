## Basilicata: Land of Wild Landscapes, Ancient History, and Authentic Culture

Hidden between the Apennine mountains and the Ionian coast, Basilicata is a region rich in hidden treasures, breathtaking landscapes, and a millennia-old history that fascinates and surprises every visitor.

## Untouched Landscapes

Basilicata is a region of extraordinary natural beauty. The stunning landscape of the Lucanian Dolomites and the Pollino National Park offers breathtaking views, with towering mountains, spectacular canyons, and ancient forests. The coasts of Basilicata, dotted with hidden coves and golden sandy beaches, invite relaxation and the discovery of small marine gems.

## History and Culture

Basilicata is rich in historical evidence that tells of ancient civilizations and millennia-old traditions. The famous "Sassi di Matera," declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are an extraordinary example of rock architecture that has its roots in the most remote past. Medieval villages like Tursi, Craco, and Castelmezzano, nestled among the mountain rocks, are treasures of history and culture that invite a journey back in time.

## Traditional Cuisine

Lucanian cuisine is a true journey into the authentic flavors of Southern Italy. From rustic dishes like "lucanica" and "lagane e ceci" to exquisite cheeses like "pecorino di Filiano," every dish is a tribute to tradition and genuineness. Not to mention the local wines, such as Aglianico del Vulture, which delight the palate of every connoisseur.
